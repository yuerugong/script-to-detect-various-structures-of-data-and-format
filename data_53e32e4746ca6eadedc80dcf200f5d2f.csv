Synopsis
In the south of France, Joseph, a former truck driver in his fifties, is struggling to keep his service station afloat since the sudden departure of his wife, Aline. Meanwhile, Vincent, a young graduate with dreams of America, hitchhikes along the road.
Vincent spots Joseph's station and sneaks in to steal some food. Joseph, in a state of inebriation, surprises and threatens him. Panic-stricken, Vincent flees, but returns when he sees Joseph collapse. After a tense discussion, Vincent asks Joseph to join him on his adventure. Joseph refuses. Before leaving, Vincent leaves a photo of his destination. Later, Joseph changes his mind and joins him in the car, and together they head west.
A few days earlier, over a family meal, Vincent announces his plans to leave for Hollywood. The news provokes a violent argument with his father Charles, a failed film producer. His mother Meryl, a former theater star, privately supports him, while his brother Dan remains indifferent. Finally, Charles, despite his initial refusal, encourages Vincent to follow his dream.
Meanwhile, Joseph discovers a letter left by Aline, explaining her need for change. They used to travel the world helping people in need.
On winding roads, Joseph and Vincent share moments of complicity, interspersed with tensions. The unpredictable Vincent steals supplies, provoking Joseph's anger but also his understanding. Under the starry sky, Joseph thinks of Aline and the promises they made to each other to stay together through thick and thin.
During the trip to an isolated café, Vincent is drawn to Wendy, a dreamy waitress eager to escape with them. However, she remains a prisoner of her mother and gives up on following them. Leaving the café, Joseph and Vincent discuss Wendy, approaching the last signpost before the French west coast.
On the other side of the Atlantic, Wendy finally joins them, embarked on this unforeseen adventure. During a night stop in a new town, Joseph, who has become unstable, is seriously injured after a bar fight, and their car is destroyed. The journey slows down, fatigue and anger set in.
Once recovered, the three friends resume their journey, despite exhaustion and growing tensions. One night, lost in the middle of nowhere, Joseph and Vincent confront each other under an indifferent sky. In the middle of an argument, a bright light appears in the distance : the Hollywood sign is finally revealed.
At the end of the trip, Vincent decides to stay in Hollywood to pursue his dreams, while Joseph flies home. A few days later, Joseph meets up with Aline, who has returned home. In the mail, a photo of Vincent and Wendy under the Hollywood sign symbolizes their fulfilled dream and the journey of initiation they've taken.
