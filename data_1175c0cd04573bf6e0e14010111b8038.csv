ARTEX: Revolutionizing Art Investment and Democratizing Access to Masterpieces,https://magazine.artland.com/artex-revolutionizing-art-investment-and-democratizing-access-to-masterpieces/,"Article
ByArtland Editors
“Before starting ARTEX, we realized that we are, above all, art lovers“
In a world where art has often been perceived as an exclusive asset class for the ultra-wealthy, ARTEX Global Markets (hereinafter ARTEX) is pioneering a revolutionary approach to democratizing art investment. At the helm of this groundbreaking venture is Yassir Benjelloun-Touimi, Co-Founder & CEO, a passionate art lover and visionary leader who is on a mission to make high-value art accessible to everyone. Alongside Yassir is H.S.H. Prince Wenceslas of Liechtenstein, Chairman & Co-Founder, whose unique background in both art and banking has been instrumental in bridging these two worlds. His extensive knowledge of the art market, combined with his financial expertise, helps guide ARTEX’s mission to merge traditional investment strategies with the beauty and cultural significance of fine art. In an insightful conversation, Yassir shares the journey behind ARTEX, the challenges of bringing this concept to life, and the future he and Prince Wenceslas envision for art investment.
“Before starting ARTEX, we realized that we are, above all, art lovers,” says Yassir. His passion for art dates back to his early years when he moved to France to immerse himself in the rich art scene of Paris. This deep-rooted love for art, combined with a keen understanding of the art market’s dynamics, laid the foundation for ARTEX.
Yassir identified a significant gap in the art market: the vast majority of art buyers who purchase works for under $100,000 have a high probability of seeing their investment depreciate over time. Conversely, only a select few can afford artworks worth millions, which almost certainly appreciate in value. ARTEX aims to bridge this gap by enabling collective ownership of high-value artworks, thereby allowing more people to benefit from the appreciation of valuable art.
“We wanted to make it possible for most people to not only love art but also benefit from its virtues and value appreciation,” Yassir explains. ARTEX achieves this by creating an exchange—a highly regulated platform where individuals can invest in shares of high-value art pieces.
The foundation of ARTEX lies in its rigorous curation process. Yassir emphasizes that the quality of the underlying asset is paramount. “We consider the artist as the brand,” he notes. ARTEX focuses on artists who have proven their worth over time, with most having sold works for over $40 million. Their selection process hinges on three criteria: the quality, rarity, and provenance of the artwork.
ARTEX targets pieces from the peak periods of the most relevant artists. For example, they aim to bring a 1932 Picasso or a 1960s Francis Bacon to the platform—works that represent the zenith of these artists’ contributions to art history. By doing so, they enhance the investment quality for their clients and ensure that the artworks maintain their value over time.
ARTEX goes beyond merely offering investment opportunities; it also aims to educate the public about art. “Most people love art but don’t feel they belong,” Yassir remarks. To address this, ARTEX provides accessible information about the art market and its artists, demystifying what has traditionally been an exclusive world.
“We focus on a few of the most important artists and deliver information in the simplest possible way,” Yassir says. ARTEX’s goal is to create a narrative that resonates with people, making art appreciation more inclusive and less daunting. They also collaborate with museums to lend artwork, thereby allowing more people to experience these masterpieces firsthand.
Building ARTEX has been a journey filled with complexities, from acquiring licenses to gaining the trust of banks and collectors. Yassir candidly describes the process as “very, very complicated.” However, he attributes the success of ARTEX to an unwavering commitment to their mission. “My experience in leadership has been centered around one thing: never give up,” he asserts.
Yassir and his team have navigated numerous hurdles, driven by a deep belief in the value they are bringing to society. They have had to adapt and refine their approach many times, but this persistence has fostered a company culture rooted in passion, humility, and resilience. This determination has also attracted a network of supporters who believe in the transformative potential of ARTEX.
ARTEX is not just reshaping the art market; it is redefining how society interacts with art. By allowing people to invest as little as $100 in high-value art, ARTEX opens the door for a broader audience to partake in the art market. Yassir envisions a future where art is not just a cultural treasure but also a viable and accessible investment for everyone.
In addition to providing investment opportunities, ARTEX plays a vital role in supporting museums and cultural institutions. Many museums struggle to fund the conservation and exhibition of artworks. ARTEX lends high-caliber art to these institutions, ensuring that masterpieces continue to be accessible to the public while also serving as a magnet to draw more visitors.
ARTEX’s innovative approach has garnered international attention, including an invitation from Harvard to be featured as a case study.The Harvard Business School case studydelves into ARTEX’s business model, providing a platform for in-depth discussions about the future of art investment. Yassir recounts the honor of engaging with some of the brightest minds at Harvard, where the story of ARTEX sparked enthusiasm and generated thought-provoking dialogue.
“It was amazing to see the engagement and the popularity of the subject,” Yassir reflects. This recognition not only underscores the impact of ARTEX’s mission but also highlights the growing interest in alternative investments and the evolving role of art in society.
“We wanted to make it possible for most people to not only love art but also benefit from its virtues and value appreciation”
ARTEX is at the forefront of a new era in the art world—one that champions accessibility, education, and the democratization of art investment. By offering a platform that combines quality, protection, and freedom, ARTEX is making it possible for more people to engage with and benefit from the world of high-value art. Through perseverance, innovation, and a commitment to cultural enrichment, Yassir Benjelloun-Touimi and his team are redefining what it means to invest in art.
In a market historically reserved for the elite, ARTEX is paving the way for a more inclusive future where art lovers and investors alike can partake in the appreciation and preservation of cultural heritage. As Yassir puts it, “This is the most important thing I’m doing in my life,” and its impact is only just beginning.

"Interview: Sophie Neuendorf, Vice President of Artnet",https://magazine.artland.com/sophie-neuendorf-interview/,"Interviews
The Vice President of Artnet on Growing Up in the Art World, Innovation in the Art Market, and the Power of List-Making
ByArtland Editors
“I’ve seen several different sides of the market…and that’s quite valuable.”
In an exclusive interview with Artland Magazine, Sophie Neuendorf, Vice President of Artnet, shared her unique journey through the art world – a blend of heritage and innovation. From the quiet of the Spanish countryside, she took a moment to reflect on her multifaceted career and her trajectory in the art world, rooted in a lifetime of experiences, familial legacy, and a deep commitment to fostering artistic talent.
Sophie’s introduction to the art world was nothing short of organic. “I feel like I’ve been born into the art world,” she remarked, recounting her father’s initial ventures as an art dealer in Hamburg. Her early memories include mingling with prominent figures like Leo Castelli and being surrounded by works from the likes of Warhol and Lichtenstein. This upbringing was not merely about exposure; it instilled in Sophie a nuanced comprehension of both the creative and commercial facets of the art market.
The family’s move to New York when her father, Hans Neuendorf, founded Artnet further immersed her in the industry’s heartbeat. Her career trajectory took her through various roles. From interning at Christie’s early on in her career to pivotal positions at Artnet, including Gallery Network and Partnerships Director and her current role as Vice President, Sophie experienced different angles of the art industry. “I’ve seen several different sides of the market…and that’s quite valuable. It’s been very helpful for my life today,” she noted.
Among her numerous responsibilities, Sophie takes pride in the Neuendorf Residency in Mallorca, a project that further adds to the Balearic islands’ thriving art scene. “We wanted to create something of value,” she explained. The residency was born out of a desire to keep their family summer house alive and soulful while also providing support to emerging artists. By converting an extra building into a studio, the Neuendorf family established a haven where creativity could flourish inspired by the Mediterranean land and seascape and the striking minimalist architecture specially designed by John Pawson and Claudio Silvestrin for the Neuendorf family in the late ‘80s.
Setting up his temporary studio at the Neuendorf House this year is William Monk, but the residency has already hosted several notable artists, including Louise Giovanelli, Christine Safa, and Nathanaëlle Herbelin, whose work was featured this spring at the Musée d’Orsay as part of the museum’s project dedicated to emerging artists who are gaining critical acclaim. “The synergies were just amazing,” Sophie said, highlighting the collaboration between the residence, the artists, their galleries, and Artnet News, which supports the project and the artists editorially to help bridge the gap between art creation and market engagement.
“One thing that you have that nobody can ever take away from you is your knowledge. And then when you have that, my advice is to give it back.”
Beyond her executive role at Artnet, Sophie is also a professor at IE University in Madrid. “They wanted the angle that I was passionate about: the intersection between art and finance,” she shared. Her goal is to demystify the art market’s complexities for her students, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making and understanding art as both a cultural and financial asset.
Sophie’s commitment to education extends her influence, preparing the next generation to navigate the art world with a balanced view of passion and practicality and debunking the misconceptions about the art world being all exhibition openings and champagne. “There’s a lot of career opportunities in the art world for people studying business… not only as gallerists,” she noted. “The amount of people knowledgeable about art and finance and business is still relatively limited, but that’s something that’s going to be more asked for in the future. So that’s the kind of knowledge I want to give them.”
Managing her extensive responsibilities requires meticulous organization. When asked how she juggles her diverse array of projects and her busy schedule, she revealed her inclination toward list-making and setting reminders on her phone. The rest is just about prioritizing and organizing effectively. “It’s a bit of the work smarter, not harder thing,” she said.
In an industry that is still predominantly male-dominated, Sophie’s journey has not been without challenges. She explained how she often felt underestimated at the beginning of her career – although this turned into an opportunity sometimes, “you overdeliver against expectation,” she reflected. Her advice to young women aspiring to leadership roles is to invest in one’s own education and training to be able to understand as many aspects as possible of an art business, not only the art part. “One thing that you have that nobody can ever take away from you is your knowledge. And then when you have that, my advice is to give it back.” Her recommendation comes from experience as she has expanded on her education with courses on executive finance, ESG reporting, global politics and economics, and now sits in two boards.
While initiatives like the Neuendorf Residency show the commitment to fostering and supporting artistic talent, Sophie’s vision for the future seems to involve a more sustainable and dynamic art world where business acumen and artistic passion coexist harmoniously.
Looking ahead, Sophie sees the art market evolving, with a greater emphasis on transparency and data. Tokenization is a valuable solution, she says, if adopted widely. “Gallerists, above all, need to understand that it’s in their best interest to have this type of transparency.”
Experience has taught her that the art industry can be slow to adapt to innovation. She recalls times when forward-thinking initiatives, such as online auctions, were launched ahead of their time but were only fully embraced by the art world years later. “Sometimes the art market just needs time to catch up,” she says.

In Conversation With Leading Art Market Expert and Best-Selling Author Magnus Resch,https://magazine.artland.com/magnus-resch-interview/,"Interviews
ByLucija Bravic
Recently published by Phaidon, a new book by best-selling author and art market expert Magnus Resch provides brilliant guidance on art collecting and demystifies the current global art market through a data-driven approach. In ‘How to Collect Art’, both seasoned collectors and newcomers to the art market can find useful tips and insights.
Drawing from the largest research study conducted on the art market, his twenty years of experience in the art industry and case studies with insiders in the field, Magnus distilled the best practices in the process of collecting art. He reflects on popular topics such as responsible art buying and the significance of building diversified art collections, both personal and institutional ones.
We had the pleasure of asking Magnus a few questions about his interest in the economics of art, his view on inclusivity in the industry, misconceptions about collecting practices, and much more.
“Why should you buy art? I advocate for what I call “responsible buying,” which entails purchasing art that speaks to you on a personal level.”
I am passionate about making the art market more transparent to encourage greater participation in art buying. I pursue this goal across various avenues: as a teacher at Yale, I educate MBA students and cultivate them into a new generation of collectors; through my books, I aim to reach a wider audience and impart knowledge about the art world; in my entrepreneurial endeavors, I leverage technology to democratize the market. For instance, I developed an app that functioned like Shazam for art, simplifying the process of art identification, while@larrys_list, showcases some of the most intriguing collectors worldwide and has become one of the most watched Instagram accounts in the art world. Through these diverse efforts, I strive to empower individuals to engage with and appreciate art in new and meaningful ways.
Absolutely, the art world operates on a global scale, with artistic creation flourishing in every corner of the globe, even in the most remote locations. However, the market itself tends to be concentrated in major hubs like New York, London, and Hong Kong. This poses a dilemma for galleries: should they prioritize proximity to the supply of art or to the demand? In my experience, I always advise galleries to prioritize proximity to the demand side, as ultimately, they need to sell their artwork.
Current research indicates that female artists, members of the LGBTQ+ community, and artists of color are facing significant underrepresentation in the art market. They are not given equal opportunities in terms of exhibitions, prices, sales, and gallery representation when compared to their male white peers. The art market is characterized by systemic inequality, where a small number of mostly white male painters dominate the industry. A shift of this magnitude will likely span generations, but we are witnessing significant changes already, propelled by the efforts of collectors like Pamela J. Joyner, who wrote the foreword to my book, and artists and gallerists, many of whom have also contributed to my book.
The gap between the top players and the rest of the market is widening rapidly. Currently, just 20 artists account for over 50% of the revenue in the auction market for contemporary art. Essentially, we’re witnessing the emergence of two distinct art worlds: one dominated by a select few active players in what can be described as the “holy land,” where art is treated as an investment and stardom is cultivated, and the other comprising the remaining 99.9% of the market. My book delves into these two worlds and emphasizes the significant impact that new collectors can have by supporting artists from the broader market.
The most prevalent misconception in the art market is the belief that art is inherently a sound investment. While this may hold true for a select group of artists, it doesn’t necessarily reflect the broader market reality. As members of the art world, our primary objective should be to encourage art lovers to become art buyers. Why should you buy art? I advocate for what I call “responsible buying,” which entails purchasing art that speaks to you on a personal level. By doing so, you’re not only supporting the artist and the gallery but also contributing to the broader artistic community. Additionally, art has the power to inspire and offer new perspectives, enriching your life in meaningful ways. Ultimately, art can bring joy and fulfillment, making it a worthwhile endeavor. So go ahead, buy art and let it enrich your life!

"Nevena Prijic on Her Creative Process, Inspiration and a New Mural at the Worcester Art Museum",https://magazine.artland.com/nevena-prijic-interview-2/,"Interviews
ByShira Wolfe
“You know how the Vinča figurines look very simplified, and in that sense they also look contemporary? They look androgynous too, they’re non-binary. And I started developing this, they would just be these universal beings combining plants, humans, animal body parts, and connecting the past and the future. It’s like a hybrid creature.”
Nevena Prijic is a Serbian artist based in Los Angeles. Her vibrant abstract-figurative paintings combine intricate compositions with biomorphic forms—where plants, animals, humans and machines meet. Taking inspiration from artifacts of the Neolithic Vinča culture, active between  c. 5400 and 4500 BC in present-day Serbia and Kosovo and the largest settlement in European culture at the time along with the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture in present-day Ukraine and Romania, she develops these forms within her futuristic, transformative compositions. Prijic suggests a freedom of being through the avoidance of binary depictions and an emphasis on the interconnectedness of all things.
Shira Wolfe spoke with Prijic on the occasion of her new muralVoyager(2023) at the Worcester Art Museum (WAM).
How was the process of creating the mural at the Worcester Art Museum? You were there for two weeks right, that’s not much time!
I was there for 17 days. I’m insane, I work fast. I can’t really do anything else when I’m that focused. Especially the first few days, I was working non-stop. Until I could see that it was really coming along, I couldn’t relax. It also took getting used to because I was exposed working at the museum. So people were walking by or passing through, you know, they would go to look at the Kandinsky or some other masterpieces, and then pass by me.
Have you ever done this kind of public mural before?
I’ve only helped other artists complete their murals, but this is completely different because I had to adjust my method of painting that I usually do on canvas. You know, you have this whole system, and it’s different, because it’s on a wall, you can’t move it, and it’s huge. But in the end I think it looks great. My friends would say it looks exactly the same as on a canvas. There are a lot of details, and because it’s so big and exposed, it’s great because you can see all those details really well.
Will it stay there permanently?
It’s going to be there until the spring of 2025. I’m the first one who ever painted on that wall, and then they’ll do a rotation of artists every few years.
What is the story behind the mural? It obviously developed very naturally from your artistic practice and what you’ve been doing the past years.
I had a studio visit with a curator from the WAM in January this year, and we talked about the inspiration behind my work and the Neolithic Vinča culture, how it developed, and how the figures and the forms kind of started their own evolution. In the museum you see ancient artifacts and the progression to modern times. The mural is set between the third and fourth floor, the modern art collection is on the fourth floor, and right across from the mural is an ancient Mayan totem. The past and the future are all around. So I really wanted to do a sketch that relates to Vinča, where there are still traces, like the alien-looking head, the neck, the shoulders, the trunk, and the leg, but at the same time is transformed. You know how the Vinča figurines look very simplified, and in that sense they also look contemporary? They look androgynous too, they’re non-binary. And I started developing this, they would just be these universal beings combining plants, humans, animal body parts, and connecting the past and the future. It’s like a hybrid creature.
“In LA I discovered nature. So I started thinking about the similarities between plants and humans and machines, and began researching all that. I wanted to create something new, a new kind of human or being.”
Can you say more about how you started working with the Vinča culture? It was when you left Serbia for the States, right?
The Vinča culture is very famous in Serbia, and my dad was using those as a reference in his fine-print making. During one of my visits back home, maybe five years ago, my dad was like, “Do you want to take some of my artworks with you?” And I realized that I needed those forms to click with the drawings I was doing at the time. I was getting out of figurative painting and was trying to find ways to present a figure without being recognizable as a human. And with this, they represent a figure, but neither male nor female. So I started using those shapes of figurines and I would paint intricate drawings on top of them. Then I blended the figurine shapes with the drawings I was doing of organic shapes and cells, almost like what happens inside the body. When I merged those two, this came to be. It’s almost like creating a being in nature.
It must feel like a very free space.
Yes, it’s very creative, there are a lot of possibilities now. In my older work, it was a lot about transformation as well, how a body can change, how we can look like anything and anyone. It’s funny, I was working on how much the media impacted people here in Serbia, but once I moved to LA, I wasn’t interested in it anymore, and now I barely engage with this. In LA, I discovered nature. So I started thinking about the similarities between plants and humans and machines, and began researching all that. I wanted to create something new, a new kind of human or being.
How do you feel now that you’ve established your new creative language?
What I like about this phase is that with all the previous work, before I moved to the States, it was good and I liked it, but there was no room to develop it, and I would feel stuck. I don’t want to just create a new product, repeating the same thing over and over again. But with this more abstract work, there is the possibility of constant change and development. The progression is kind of insane. With every painting, I try to push a little bit. Taking a step back you can actually tell there are big changes.
I’m curious, who are some of your favorite artists?
My obsession for the human body and anatomy comes from the Italian Old Masters, when I was young I would be copying artworks by Leonardo Da Vinci. And even now the way I paint has traces in that, because the lines that I use for the top layer, the cross-hatching, have their root in those Renaissance drawings. Whenever I’m interested in something, then I discover artists who are doing something similar. Some contemporary artists whose work I find inspiring are Ivana Bašić, Christina Quarles, Alicia Adamerovich, and Teresa Chromati. A lot of times I’m drawn to sculpture too, because my paintings are quite sculptural.
What are some upcoming projects for you?
Next year I’ll have an exhibition in Milan with my LA gallery M+B, since they have spaces in Milan and Brazil too. The Milan space is a beautiful apartment where you can take your time and discuss art, it’s more homey than the in-and-out experience of the white cube. Other than that, I’ll spend more time developing and not rushing too much. Having a little bit of open space for thinking and experimenting.

"Interview: Simon Elliott, Creator of Hockney’s First-Ever Graphic Biography",https://magazine.artland.com/simon-elliott-interview-hockney-book/,"Interviews  ∙  Sponsored
ByAdam Hencz
“I hope that this book brings people joy. That is what Hockney’s story is all about.”
“I am a color addict,” confesses Simon Elliott, a criminal barrister by day, while preparing for an event for his latest illustrated book, ‘Hockney: A Graphic Life.’
“I have always lovedDavid Hockney,” Elliott resumes. “He loves the world and is always trying new ways to depict it.” This pure drive and shared curiosity is evident in every page of Elliott’s graphic novel that narrates Hockney’s life with the same zest and vibrancy that marked the life and art of the British Pop Art master.
“Hockney is in his eighties, and he’s still making works daily. He isn’t just making art in the ways he has always done—he is still searching. He is still reinventing himself. That is why I decided to write and draw a biography about him.”
Elliott’s dual career as a barrister and artist might seem at odds, yet there’s a confluence in their purpose: communication and curiosity. “Whether that argument comes from submissions in court or a painting on a canvas, it’s all a method of persuasion,” he muses, drawing a parallel between his legal battles and artistic expression.
Elliott’s passion for art was reignited during the pandemic, a silver lining in an otherwise gloomy period. “I used to spend all of my time drawing, painting, or making clay sculptures, but I hadn’t made much art since my school days,” he reflects.
But the lockdown changed everything, sparking a daily ritual of drawing and painting. He found himself reconnecting with his artistic roots in a period of global stillness.
“My parents are practical, hands-on people who always encouraged me to turn off the TV and make something instead. Now I am drawing again on a daily basis,” Elliott says, “and I am so grateful for making this change. I have really come to understand the mindfulness and mental health benefits of making artwork regularly.”
The seed for ‘Hockney’ was planted long ago, rooted in Elliott’s admiration for Hockney’s use of color, humor, and diverse mediums. “I particularly fell in love with ‘A Rake’s Progress,’ his series of etchings that depict his first time in America,” he shares.
The series includes witty asides that inspired Elliott’s approach to the graphic novel, capturing Hockney’s evolution in a similar style. “It is beautifully detailed sketch-like work that really speaks to me,” he adds. ”I wanted my book to mirror this — to achieve a balance between a biography and a graphic novel where the pictures do some of the narrative work.”
The publication of the book was almost serendipitous. “I was basically finished with the writing and drawing of it, but I hadn’t really thought of what I might do with it,” Elliott reveals. A positive response from the publisher and Hockney’s personal involvement in the project were turning points in bringing the book to life.
“He sent quite a lot of biographical notes,” Elliott recalls, “including correcting the plane that I had drawn for his first flight to New York, and one drawing where I had drawn him with his hands in his pockets, he insisted on smoking in the drawing as he had been in real life,” he adds.
“Hockney is 86 now, which means that there is a lot of ground to cover for a biography,” he explains, his fingers tracing over his iPad, the companion that brought freedom to his creative process.
“The iPad goes everywhere with me,” he says. “I draw on planes, trains, in the bath, wherever I happen to be,” he shares. Elliott’s illustrations, just like Hockney’s quarantine paintings, were drawn entirely on an iPad that infused the book with diverse inspirations, from the bustling streets of Japanese metropolises to the quiet, mundane moments.
Elliott reveals his next venture – an illustrated biography ofVincent Van Gogh. “He was an incredibly intellectual artist who produced many of the most famous images in the world in only a decade of painting,” he asserts.
His fascination with Van Gogh goes beyond the clichéd image of a tortured soul. He’s more intrigued by Van Gogh’s intellectual depth and the crucial roleJo Van Gogh Bonger, his sister-in-law, played in his fame after death.
Looking forward, Elliott’s artistic horizon is vast, with aspirations to explore the lives of other influential figures likeYayoi KusamaandTakashi Murakami,Basquiat, andDavid Shrigley.

The British artist on his latest book, the joys of self-publishing and why comedy is so important.
ByAlice Godwin
David Shrigley is doing exactly what he wants when it comes to his latest book,I Am The Jug You Are The Glass(2022). Self-published through Shrig Shop in Copenhagen—which was founded with gallerist and friend Nicolai Wallner in 2021 and inspired by Keith Haring’s Pop Shop in 1980s New York—the book features three hundred black and white drawings from the past five years, filled with Shrigley’s distinctive sense of deadpan humor. The entire book is rendered in Shrigley’s familiar, childlike scrawl, from the publication details down to the barcode.
A lot has happened over the past half decade. In 2020, Shrigley was awarded an OBE by Queen Elizabeth II, which he found “unexpected and quite a strange thing to happen, but kind of positive.” Then there was the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought travel grinding to a halt. Shrigley enjoyed the opportunity to stay at home in rural Devon in south-west England and draw all day. Through this extraordinary period, Shrigley thinks his humor has not really changed. Instead, “I’ve realized the value of humor. I value it more now probably.”
This book offers a dose of wry Shrigley humor, which has garnered an international following. “I create a certain kind of comedy that people respond to,” Shrigley says. “Comedy is important, people like to laugh, but ultimately, I don’t know why people like it…you have to ask them!” For Shrigley, an artwork has to be for the artist first and foremost, “because if you don’t like it, you can’t expect anyone else to.” Shrigley acknowledges that, at times, his humor might be a little close to the bone, but it doesn’t necessarily matter what you do in the studio: “What matters is who you show the work to and when you show it to them.”
Though far from the first publication for the Turner Prize-nominated artist, Shrigley has relished the freedom of designing and editing this book himself—a process he intends to continue in the future. “Publishing with a bigger publisher is a bit of a pain in the arse,” he explains, “because you have to do it on their terms and jump through a lot of hoops.” When it comes to organizing an exhibition of his drawings, Shrigley has learned to hand over responsibility to the galleries he works with: “I always end up really surprised at what people choose. They don’t choose the things that I think are brilliant and amazing.” But this book is exactly the way he wants. In the past, Shrigley would lay out photocopies of all his drawings on a big table or the floor: “Now I do it on a computer, which is much easier and more sensible, but it’s still fun.”
For Shrigley, a book is a way to tie his drawings together in a cohesive narrative or structure. “It’s a way to give meaning to lots of individual parts,” he says, “which are then presented as a whole. That’s what I like about it.” When it comes to the meaning of his drawings, Shrigley is happy for people to make up their own minds: “It is about whatever the reader thinks it’s about.”
Shrigley has previously said that he began to draw because he had a lot to say, and drawing was the most direct way to say it. These days, Shrigley reflects, “I don’t know if I necessarily have a lot to say, but I have a need to say it, whatever it is. There’s definitely a difference there.” Shrigley’s drawings tussle with the resonance of words and images, and the slippage between the two, purposefully never using one to describe the other.
While the drawings inI Am The Jug You Are The Glassare all black and white, those in another recently published book,Get Your Shit Together, are in color (“so people can choose between the two or have both!”). For Shrigley, “there are things you can do with color works that you can’t do with black and white and vice versa. I swap between the two because you want to be able to examine everything.” By comparison, Shrigley suggests his black and white drawings are less self-contained and take less time to make than his color works. Their text is also potentially longer. When it comes to choosing between the two, Shrigley considers, “It’s a question of whatever works. Do what you want to do. Try not to get bored.”
I Am the Jug, You Are the Glass(€35) is available atshrigshop.com. Shrig Shop is on Tullinsgade 3, Copenhagen V, 2300, Denmark.

“Buy the art, invest in the artist.”
Growing up in Northern New Mexico, between Abiquiú, Taos, and Santa Fe, one of the top art markets in the United States, I’ve been surrounded by countless artists, galleries, museums, and art institutions from a young age. I frequented many gallery openings and events and formed great relationships with gallerists which led me to start my art collection. Later in life, at around the age of 20, I founded my first gallery, an online platform that represented early-career international artists, which provided me with the privilege of supporting creatives while building upon my collection at the same time.
Diverse, inspired, evolving.
The primary focus of my collection at its current stage is to support a diverse group of international artists of varied backgrounds, communities, and cultures with a focus on those who’ve historically been underrepresented, namely those in the LatinX, LGBTQIAP2S+, BIPOC, and AAPI communities, working across all mediums.
I’ve come to realize there is a recurring theme in the works I’ve collected which revolves around figurative depictions of human connection and embrace. There’s a certain relatability in those works that I resonate with and find comforting. Another notable visual element in my collection that has emerged over the years is vessels, vases, and amphorae. I’m intrigued by these historical forms and how the artists have interpreted and repurposed them to convey their message in a contemporized way.
There is a powerful work in my collection by David Heo, a Korean-American artist based in Chicago, that certainly makes an impact every time that I look at it. It is a collaged work on paper entitled, “Kinship” that – my personal interpretation – depicts a moment of suffering and unity between two individuals of differing backgrounds with seemingly shared experiences. It’s one of those works that is striking, thought-provoking, emotional, and empowering at the same time.
My taste has most definitely evolved from the early days of my collection’s formation. Initially, there was less of an objective when it came to acquiring works, although I still collected what I loved. Now I take a more considered approach especially as space constraints become a greater factor as the collection grows.
When considering an acquisition, I take into account how the work aligns with the direction and values of my collection, how I personally connect with the work, and most importantly how it benefits the artists.
As my collection has grown to well over 100 works, it is shared and displayed between my primary residence and family properties, if not in storage. I think that finding new ways to display and share one’s collection via digital and virtual spaces is an exciting element for collectors and the artists that they support. This provides new opportunities for both parties to share the work with an audience as accessibility to the work is an important factor.
I believe that as collectors, we are stewards of the work we are entrusted to own and live with, we must be responsible for how they are handled and presented. It’s important to be able to share the work and provide visibility for the artists, VR and digital platforms are a safe and effective way of reaching a greater audience.
David Heowill always be on my list of inspiring artists. His work will never cease to amaze and inspire.
Peruvian artist,Braddy Romero Ricaldeis another artist that I’m very excited about. His work has a playful yet powerful nature to it in such a unique style. The work he’s done in and for his community, writing, illustrating, and distributing bilingual children’s books for the children in the pueblos who do not have easy access to books is admirable.Marcelo Eli Sarmientois an artist that I’ve had the absolute pleasure of working with through my gallery as well as in my collection. His work tells a story through historical Latin American iconography in a refreshing contemporary style.
As I go forward, I intend to continue following the principles of my collection and support living, early-career artists across the art landscape. I always look forward to discovering and connecting with new creatives.
A common bit of advice that I have received, and the same advice that I’d give, is to just collect what resonates with you personally. Also, I will always advocate for investing in living artists. “Buy the art, invest in the artist.”

"Interview: Sara Berner Bengtsson, Director & CEO of Market Art Fair",https://magazine.artland.com/sara-berner-bengtsson-market-interview-2023/,"Interviews
ByBenedetta Ricci
“The fair holds the special position of bringing people together, from wealthy collectors and powerful industry professionals to artists and general art lovers. We want to make the most of this platform by raising important voices and discussions.”
As we await for this year’s iteration of Market Art Fair to open its doors, Artland had the pleasure to interview Sara Berner Bengtsson, Director and CEO of the fair.
Established in 2006 by galleries representing the Nordic countries, namely Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, Market has become a trusted meeting point and marketplace in Stockholm, at the heart of the Nordic art industry. The 2023 edition will be held from May 12-14 at Liljevalchs Konsthall, with the addition of an ambitious new section at the nearby Spritmuseum.
Read on to learn more about this year’s edition of the fair, its forward-looking program, and future developments.
I’ve been the Director and CEO of Market since mid-pandemic 2020. Our first goal was basically to survive as the outlook didn’t look very bright by then, a situation we shared with many event and arts organizations at that time. Now, (soon to be) three fairs later, we are welcoming a record number of galleries and collectors and are standing stronger than ever.
Since our founding by galleries from the Nordic countries, our aim has always been to strengthen the Nordic art scene. The way we do it has refined and evolved over the years, and now we are exclusively focusing on Nordic artists (by origin, residency, or artistic theme) but we welcome plenty of non-Nordic galleries, collectors, and industry professionals.
We are open to any gallery presenting Nordic artists, by origin, residency, or artistic theme, the gallery itself doesn’t need to be Nordic. We love to welcome more non-Nordic galleries! We are also a bit special in the sense that our selection committee only consists of established art industry professionals operating in a completely independent way. The galleries are only selected based on the quality of the art they present and its Nordic relevance, not taking into account any position on the art scene or personal views. That means that the audience will meet ambitious and high-quality presentations at the fair.
That said, the commercial gallery scene is not a true and fair representation of the art scene. We still lag behind in regard to representation, both when it comes to non-white artists and artists from other historically marginalized groups such as Sápmi artists. We see more and more of this also at the fair, but we do have a responsibility to speed up the process.
We wanted to expand the fair for a while now, as we have a surplus of great galleries interested in participating that we just don’t have room for at Liljevalchs. When the opportunity of expanding to Spritmuseum occurred we wanted to do something that would benefit the art scene as a whole. Market Debut exclusively focuses on up-and-coming talent with seven young galleries that have never shown at the fair before.
The Nordic art scene is currently experiencing a new energy and impetus, with numerous galleries and artists making waves. Market Debut is our response to that dynamism and aims to ignite inspiring dialogues, connect, and build relationships between young galleries and Market Art Fair’s strong network of collectors.
Yes, that’s something we are thrilled about. The fair holds the special position of bringing people together, from wealthy collectors and powerful industry professionals to artists and general art enthusiasts, and we want to make the most of this platform by raising important voices and discussions. I’m especially excited about having Dr. Thomas Girst, BMW Head of Culture give a talk. Although we are a Nordic fair, our standpoint is global and filled with wide-ranging insights and inspiration.
I think we are at a challenging time with the global recession, and here in Sweden we also have an extremist right-wing party with influence over cultural politics. Meeting places in the art world, both globally and regionally, will become more important – while we also must question the habit of flying all over the world.
For Market Art Fair, our space limitations are at the same time a blessing and a curse. While hosting the fair at Liljevalchs and Spritmuseum creates a unique and personal feeling, I sometimes toy with the idea of what Market Art Fair could be if we had the possibility of a global-fair setting like a huge tent or exhibition center and could double the number ofexhibitors. Maybe it’s something we should do as a one-off event celebrating the fair’s 20-year anniversary? Time will tell…
The digital iteration of Market Art Fair 2023 will run on Artland until May 28.Sign up here to get VIP accessto the fair online and receive exclusive fair content.

Raphaël Isvy Collection in VR | Collector Interview,https://magazine.artland.com/raphael-isvy-vr-collector-interview-2/,"Art Collecting Insights
ByBenedetta Ricci
Based in Paris, Raphaël Isvy is a young French collector with a penchant for distorted portraits and sci-fi. We are delighted to feature his collection as part of Artland’s campaign that provides art collectors with cutting-edge VR technology to maximize their passion for collecting.
Read on to learn more about how he started collecting, what he sees in the future of his collection, and much more.
Discover the works from the Raphaël Isvy Collectionhere.
To me, collecting is an addiction—once you start, it’s hard to quit. It all started with vinyl covers, sneakers collab, street art and designer toys. Once I put the first step into it, it evolved into a game and a passion that today means everything to me.
Talent; Balance; Rising stars.
If you check my Instagram (@raph_is) you’ll probably only find figurative, portraits and distorted faces… it’s my thing I don’t know why; probably it’s because I’m a dreamer and a true fan of fantasy and sci-fi.
Probably the George Condo or the Robin Francesca Williams. First of all, they’re masterpieces and a pleasure to have them in my living environment, but they also gave me confidence that I could build something relevant and established, and also prove to the world that I was taking collecting seriously.
Definitely. I started collecting urban art, then edition prints, then cartoon/Kawai, and finally ended up collecting contemporary art. I guess the more you see things, the more you train your eye and refine your taste.
The artwork itself always comes first, but it’s not enough. I look at a lot of things such as pieces in other collections or galleries, and prices, but mostly I aim to buy works that are representative of an artist’s practice. It’s better not to collect a piece if it’s not unique and truly characteristic of the artist’s style.
I display my collection at home, but also at my parents’ and my brother’s places, and in storage. I rotate the hanging a lot to have the chance to enjoy my collection as much as possible. VR is cool but I don’t have the appropriate equipment to fully enjoy it.
I will try mixing young emerging, confirmed and established artists; let’s sayTracey Emin, Christopher Hartmann and Nika Kutateladze.
I always try to enrich the collection with more and more works by blue-chip artists and quality images and enlarge my network while trying to connect the dots between all the actors in the art world.
Always buy what you like and try to build a strong network if you can. The more art you see the better trained will your eye be.

Interview with Contemporary Art Dealer & Collector Adam Baldwin,https://magazine.artland.com/adam-baldwin-interview/,"Interview
ByAdam Hencz
“I’ve always believed that a gallery should serve its collectors by standing as a sort of cultural coterie.”
London-based dealer and collector Adam Baldwin opened his eponymous gallery,Baldwin Contemporary,in his early 30s and soon after gained a reputation for himself as a serious dealer of important post-war and contemporary art.
Operating from a by-appointment space housed within a white stucco-fronted victorian townhouse in London’s exclusive South Kensington district, with his multidisciplinary focus and a deep ambition to carve out a niche for himself in the global art world, it’s easy to see how, in just 4 years, Baldwin has amassed a roster of high profile clients. And what’s more – he’s done this all without having a traditional gallery space.
In this interview, Adam shares his thoughts on the importance of private sales and discusses his gallery’s new publishing venture,Baldwin Books. This series of publications will explore the artists, genres, and themes that Baldwin Contemporary handles, providing an opportunity for collectors to engage in thought-provoking discourse.
From his approach to promotion and sales to the future of the gallery, this interview offers a glimpse into the workings of one of the rapidly emerging talents in the art world.
Your gallery specializes in secondary-market work by acclaimed artists who are well-known for their contributions to popular art genres and movements. It’s also clear from speaking to you that private sales are the central part of your gallery’s strategy. What would need to happen for you to reconsider running a primary program?
You know, I get approached a lot by artists looking for representation. There’s a lot of noise in the gallery world right now, and so I think it’s more important than ever to be honest with yourself as to exactly where your value is. To me, so far, that’s been the handling of post-war and contemporary works of art on thesecondary market, conducted in a private sales setting. I don’t want to lose sight of that.
Running a primary program would be a totally different ballgame, especially to do it at the level I’d want it to operate at. And so, whilst I’m certainly not ruling anything out, it just doesn’t really feel like the right route for us just now.
How would you describe your clientele or a typical Baldwin Contemporary collector?
Informed, passionate, knowledgeable.
Baldwin Contemporary is releasing a series of publications this year – Baldwin Books. Can you tell us more about this project? Who are you working with on these publications?
I’m very excited about this project. Baldwin Books has been created to allow us to present our collectors with intriguing discourse in and around the artists, genres, and thematics that we handle. I’ve always believed that a gallery should serve its collectors by standing as a sort of cultural coterie, and what I’m really focused on right now is building a strong and loyal community of collectors who share our passions and beliefs. And so for that reason alone, this project feels important to me.
As a successful gallery owner and collector, you must have come across many individuals in the art world and beyond who have inspired and impressed you. Are there any other dealers or professionals, past or present, who you particularly admire?
Saatchi. Gagosian. Castelli.
Are there any specific artists or movements you consider undervalued today? How do you balance the desire to take risks on lesser-known or underrecognized artists with the need to sell works guaranteed to perform well on the market?
I get asked this question a lot. The truth is that periods of dislocation between art history and the art market are much more common than they probably should be. Just look at Rauschenberg’s market. Or the overall under-appreciation of female artists throughout art history. Or, dare I say it, some of the prices are currently being spent on emerging work right now.
I’ve said this before, but one particular area where I see value right now is inthe early YBAs. And I’m not talking about theHirstandEminmarkets but rather the other members of the group who were still hugely important in the movement. I’m talking aboutGary Hume‘s hospital doors,Gavin Turk‘s trompe-l’oeil series, Angus Fairhurst’s gorillas,Sarah Lucas‘ Bunny girls, Jake and Dinos Chapman’s iconoclastic sculptures, Abigail Lane’s ink pads and so on. And there’s loads more. Some of these works are hugely important pieces when contextualized within art history, but the market right now just isn’t reflecting this. I’ve seen so many of these works come to market over the past couple of years at what I think are pretty low prices relative to their historical importance. It’s a good buying opportunity right now.
“For me it’s not about pursuing growth for growth’s sake. Right now, I’m just happy honing in on what we’re getting right and building a passionate community.”
I’m curious about your approach to promotion and sales in the art world. It is a fiercely competitive field, so how do you generate enthusiasm and momentum for your gallery and position it within high-profile collector circles?
We focus on private sales, so we don’t need to operate an extensive exhibition-led marketing strategy. It’s just not our style.
Our modus operandi is actually quite simple – we want to work with passionate collectors around the world to help them build and manage important, respected, and interesting collections of post-war and contemporary art. At the end of the day, that’s really what it’s all about, right? And we’re fortunate enough to have been able to build the gallery around a loyal community of collectors who follow us and trust what we do. And right now, we’re just focused on serving them in the best way possible.
Whilst most of what I spend my time doing these days is what you’d call ‘offline,’ my team here runs a fairly extensive online presence too. For our online efforts, most of the inventory we market online is blue-chip prints and multiples up to about £100,000. That’s actually how we first got started.
What advice would you give to new gallerists just starting out?
Be honest. Be reliable. And learn quick.
You opened a gallery in your early 30s, and within just four years, you have rapidly established your name in the global contemporary art scene. As you look towards the future, where do you see the gallery in another four years, and what are your ambitions and strategies for continuing to grow and evolve? You mentioned researching the possibility of opening an office in the US. What other locations would you consider expanding to in the future?
A lot of my clients are located in the US, and we’ve kept inventory over there for some time now too. So opening a US space at some point, probably Los Angeles would be an obvious next step for us. But frankly speaking, right now, we’re just focusing on a centralization strategy here in London. We’ve grown over the past couple of years which we’re very grateful for, but for me, it’s not about pursuing growth for growth’s sake. Right now, I’m just happy honing in on what we’re getting right and building out our community from here.

“We prioritize the emotions and stories that art evokes rather than focusing solely on whether or not it aligns with our personal taste. “
Artland caught up with Danish art advisor, curator, and collector J.B. Fals on the occasion of the recent Virtual Reality release of the contemporary art collection he shares with his partner R. Prates. Read on to learn more about how the collection started, where it is heading, and several points in between.
Explore a selection of works from the Fals & Prates Collection in VRhere.
Ever since I was young, I have been captivated by the creativity, authenticity, and courage of artists. In my mid-twenties I realized that my ability was not to create art but to help artists facilitate their unique skills. ThroughOriginal Paper Worksand curating art shows, I have now found the way to best express my ability, and I couldn’t be more pleased. I started my collection in my twenties by myself, but later in life I joined forces with my significant other, and we now share the passion for art collecting.
Artists We Admire.
Our collection is mostly divided into two main sections. The first one features artists who currently reside or work in Denmark. Living in Copenhagen makes it convenient for us to interact with local artists. The second one focuses on contemporary artists in and around the city of London. London is a special place and the amount of creative forces in the city is unbelievable. We have been fortunate to cultivate friendships and connections in London over the years.
Each piece of art holds a unique story and a special place in our hearts. I would love to share the stories of all of them, but if I had to choose one, I would highlight “Boat trip from Hoxton to Wick” byIgor Moritz. This painting was featured in a group show that I curated in Copenhagen and as soon as I unpacked it, I was hypnotised by it. I later had the opportunity to visit Igor in his Hackney studio and saw the same canal and houseboats that were depicted in the painting. It was an extraordinary moment for me as both a collector and a curator.
Others may argue that we have a specific taste when it comes to collecting art, but that is not how we view it. We prioritize the emotions and stories that art evokes rather than focusing solely on whether or not it aligns with our personal taste. Art would lose relevance over time if we were to choose based solely on aesthetics and personal taste.
While if the selection is based on the emotions and stories art excites, we can be sure that that specific artwork will always hold a special place in our hearts.
Are you touched by the artwork? Are you moved by the artist?
Does it evoke something within you, be it positive or negative? Art is all about emotions, and not all emotions are pleasant, but they are all still very meaningful.
Currently, I am particularly drawn to the work of Austrian artist Anna Rettl. She is inspired by accomplished female artists such as Miriam Cahn and Anne Kollwitz, yet still manages to make her paintings entirely her own. I am also eagerly looking forward to Shuo Hao’s solo exhibition later this year. I am drawn to Hao’s art as it takes inspiration from both Western and Eastern cultures. Lastly, I would like to mention Danish artist Tomas Leth. I acquired my first artworks from Tomas in 2019. His abstract paintings and paper works are truly remarkable; they possess an immense depth while still being delicate. I believe our collection could benefit from more abstract artworks like his.
We are eager to expand the diversity of our collection. We hope to acquire more artworks from artists who worked all throughout the past century. Currently, the collection has a strong focus on contemporary art, but in the next decade we hope to add more pieces from the second half of the 20th century.
I try to avoid seeking advice, preferring instead to engage in meaningful conversations with artists. I am interested in the craft and thought process behind an artwork and not in the urge to collect.
My two pieces of advice for aspiring collectors would be:
First, curate a collection with purpose and significance rather than simply following current trends. Your collection should remain relevant and meaningful 20-30 years from now. Remember, collecting art is about more than just having something aesthetically pleasing to display in your home. To truly be a collector, immerse yourself in the art and develop a deep understanding of it.
Secondly, if you are committed to collecting, you have to be patient and disciplined. Galleries may tempt you with the latest and greatest, but stick to your plan and don’t be afraid to say no if that doesn’t align with the direction of your collection. Building a collection takes time and requires a mass amount of patience and discipline.

Artist Interview: Peter Frederiksen,https://magazine.artland.com/peter-frederiksen-artist-interview/,"Interview
Interview byAdam Hencz
With thread and needle, Peter Frederiksen defies convention and elevates embroidery to an art form. Inspired by classic cartoons such as Looney Tunes and The Simpsons, Frederiksen’s creations feature intricate embroidery on linen canvas stretched onto wooden panels.
His uniquetextile artuses a standard sewing machine in a free-motion style, resulting in a dense, hypnotic effect. Frederiksen carefully curates screenshots from old cartoons, editing and cropping them to create a compelling narrative. His art delves into the violent moments in cartoons, capturing knives piercing doors and hands contorting while playing the piano.
With his upcoming exhibition titledCoward!, Frederiksen explores the human experience of fear and failure. He questions the success of his previous works, asking himself whether people appreciate his art for the imagery or the threads he is pulling at. The exhibition includes 19 new works, with three larger pieces featuring embroideries on jacquard weavings, breaking new ground in his medium. The titular piece stands out, a blank canvas with the wordCoward!painted in cursive, casting a shadow over a newly-set sun.
In our interview, Frederiksen opens up about his creative process and questions whether he is brave enough to explore new territories. Yet his dedication to his craft shines through, and his unique approach to embroidery is here to inspire those who appreciate the art of storytelling – through the thread.
Like so many, I grew up with Looney Tunes as a Saturday morning staple. My father and my brother, and I would watch, my father in his tattered robe with his coffee, and my brother and I with our sugary cereal. My memories are more of this than of the cartoons, specifically, but if I had to pick one out, of course, I remember the pinnacle:What’s Opera, Doc?, the Fantasia-spoofing Wagner opera between Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. I probably remember it most because I’m sure it was the most popular. The ways in which I have been inspired by these Saturday mornings are so deeply-rooted that I am positive that it’s no longer influence but foundational.
Sometimes it starts as an idea that I then research and find imagery for, and other times it comes about from just watching episodes of Looney Tunes and responding to images or ideas. My compositions all start as collections of screenshots, compiled to make whatever scene I’m trying to depict. Usually, there’s some heavy cropping happening, focusing on small details.
We’re living in interesting times! I wake up in the morning every day to news alerts on my phone about the terrible things that happened in the last 24 hours across the globe. My anxieties about the state of things permeate my waking thoughts. Fortunately, I don’t really dream. Hahaha.
Putting these anxieties into art helps me to understand why I think about them and why they’re important to me. Through the lens of 80-year-old cartoons, they don’t feel so profound or new – we’re dealing with a lot of the same shit that has been circling for generations. They’re silly, but they’re also not going anywhere, which can be depressing. Ultimately, we’re right to worry about violence and global warming, and the well-being of our fellow humans. It’s essential to being human, worrying. Fearing. It’s animal, but we learn from it.
Metaphors call for repetition. Throughout the show, there are six pieces showing trees in different stages of being chopped down. I wanted to emphasize this as work that had been started but unfinished, similar to my self-reflection. Some of the trees are standing tall despite the actions taken against them; some trees appear to be teetering, close to falling over; one tree defies gravity altogether. These trees are denied growth and purpose at once, perpetually stuck in transition.
Then there’s the other tree, shown in the only black-and-white image titledForging a path. showing a sort of shortcut. What could have been either a left or a right is presented as something else; here, the tree which may have started as an obstacle is shown to be surmountable, should one only be able to ignore our laws of physics. Another defiance of growth, but in a much more childish manner: by making my own rules, I control the game.
Guaranteeing an outcome is another recurring motif, shown inI know what I’m doing, I’ve played this game before, andGoing easy on myself.More of the same, really, but these are about the prevention of growth through an insistence on winning. When a game becomes about an outcome, you risk losing perspective.
I’ve been drawn to fiber artwork for a long time now, and free-motion machine embroidery is a very efficient way to make the kinds of images I want to be making. Once upon a time, I did hand embroidery, and my wrist will likely make a clicking noise for the rest of my life thanks to hand embroidery. Hahaha. I used to paint, I used to draw. I still love those methods of expression, but machine embroidery excites me. In the same vein, I’m excited to continue experimenting with fiber sculpture and digital-focused work like jacquard.
Hahaha, I think every series is challenging until it’s done. Like withCoward!and the one work acting as a sort of Rosetta Stone for me, each body of work I make is sweat, blood, and tears until I get to a place where I view it as a whole. Getting distance from a series is essential for me, both figuratively and literally. I find that it’s really helpful to take small photographs of the works and view them together on one screen. A new perspective.
My day job! I work with commercial photographers, directors, illustrators, animators, and everything in between to make ads. I started working in ad agencies like 12 years ago, first as an office handyman and then (through, essentially, luck) as a producer. I worked in agencies for a long time, and when I broke out, I was lucky (again) to be able to join forces with one of my best friends, Andrea, who had an artist representation company that she owned and operated. Working for yourself with one of your best friends is the dream.
We represent a small roster of artists, producing work for whoever will hire us. We recently did a whole mess of work for Jell-O!
I’ve not experimented with AI yet, but I’m not against the idea! I’ve seen some very basic conversation surrounding the aping and appropriation of specific styles of art and specific artworks for things like AI portrait apps, and, like, I see why this is bothering people, I guess, but I just do not care. I hope that collectors go nuts for AI artworks. I see this as growth. Embracing new tech is great. If any artist can make a killing on it, go for it. Make some more bored apes or something. Pay it forward, tho. Sell art, buy art.
I’ve been working a lot on embroidery into jacquard weaving, attempting to marry the digital and the physical a little more. Old tech meets new tech, that kinda thing. I’m working on the largest work I’ve ever made (the largest by a lot), and it’ll probably take a few more weeks to get it to a good place, but I’m excited to try something BIG. My work is so small, so this feels very different for me. I’ve got two more solo shows this year, so I’ve got my work cut out for me.
