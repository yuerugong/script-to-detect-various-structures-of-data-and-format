Over 200,000 pieces. That's the number ofcontemporary artworksanddesign objectscurrently available on Artsper. Every day, newartistsandgalleries from all over the worldjoin us and trust us to showcase their work. On Artsper, all mediums have a place of choice:painting,drawing,photography,editionsandsculpture.The generic term ""contemporary art"" refers to all works produced in the recent period, that is to say between the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st centuries. However, there is not only one type of contemporary art. It can cover as many forms as there are artists, if not more. Contemporary art, while taking into account the individualities and the cultural specificities, takes life at the world level, in a globalized society and constantly in movement. Thus, the materials used, the processes of creation and the subjects treated by the contemporary art works often reflect these interconnections. But one constant remains, artists perpetually question the established artistic order.Even if they are often confused, there are many differences between modern and contemporary art, notably the idea that contemporary art works are more conceptual and privilege the creative idea to the support used.Nevertheless, the distinction between these two movements can also be purely temporal. Any work realized after 1945 can be called ""contemporary"". At the beginning of the 20th century, the movements followed one another according to the revolutionary reflections of the great masters of Surrealism (Salvador Dalí,René Magritte), Cubism (Pablo Picasso,Fernand Léger) and Dadaism (Marcel Duchamp). From the 1950s and 1960s, artists pushed the reflection on abstraction even further. This is the birth ofminimalist artas well as conceptual art. In opposition to theabstract expressionistssuch asJoan Mitchell,Mark RothkoandJackson Pollock, the leaders of these movements are notablyFrank StellaandSol Lewitt.Pop artis one of the first artistic movements to emerge from contemporary art. It was the work of a whole generation caught up in the whirlwind of consumer society. Pop art uses new technologies andvery bright colorsto portray (sometimes ironically) this globalized world in transition. The precursors of this pictorial technique areRoy LichtensteinandAndy Warhol, whose modern paintings represent icons of the time such asMarilyn MonroeorElizabeth Taylor.Born in the 1960s in Philadelphia,street artbecame popular in the 1980s. Illegal and controversial at first, it now occupies a major place in modern art museums, galleries and private collections. Paintings,stencil drawings,collages, sculpture,tags,graffiti... On Artsper, discover original contemporary artworks as well asprintsby the greatest street artists:Shepard Fairey (Obey),JonOne,Aiko,Miss.Tic,Jef Aérosoland many others. But our catalog also highlightsyoung starsand talents of the emerging scene, such asDeath NYCorJérôme Mesnager.Today, contemporary art exists in many forms, more or less inspired by the movements that have shaped modern history. The beginning of the 21st century is marked by a multidisciplinary creation, an interest for creation coming from the four corners of the world, and the emergence of markets on different continents. Contemporary artworks also denote a meteoric growth indigital art, as evidenced by the recent boom inNFTsand AI (artificial intelligence)-generated art. As with all art forms, we see a globalized interest in innovative and disruptive contemporary artworks as much as in work that aims to revive the more traditional forms of fine art.Whether you're a budding collector or a seasoned buyer, a home decorator or an art history buff, now is the time to express your personality by exploring the collections of our 1,800 partner galleries, which are constantly being updated with new works of contemporary art.

Artsper has a large selection of modern and contemporary canvas paintings for you to discover, organized under our various headers and themes. Painting has been a means of expression for mankind from Prehistoric times to the modern day, making it a true ambassador for the fine arts. Even today, it embodies the visual arts par excellence.
Oil paintings, watercolors, ink washes and even acrylics; there are many different techniques which allow the painter to achieve the desired effect. Mixing pigments with synthetic resin make it acrylic, while adding delicately grinded gum arabic, transform it into gouache and watercolor. Instreet art, painting takes shape on walls using spray cans, but painting can adapt to all kinds of supports. Often more frequently used on canvas, paintings can also be created on wood, paper… there are no limits to the surfaces the artist can use it on.
A painting is above all the concept and ideas behind the brushstrokes and the artistic process. With this in mind, two key trends contrast with each other:figurative artandabstract art. However, they are merely two guiding principles amongst the host of pictorial movements which have been developed throughout the years and have come to establish the history of art. Each of these artistic movements have played their part, often drawing on achievements from the past or by doing the exact opposite of previous techniques. As withminimalistpainting and thePop artmovement, the norms have evolved and they are no longer the same, creating new aesthetics and changing the way we view art.
The practice of painting continues to evolve with the succession of movements and artistic experimentation, as artists become interested in new techniques and try to deal with new issues. Certain artists highlight the importance of color, whilst others focus on form or light. The Impressionists, for example, gave a great deal of importance to what the eye truly saw, whereas the Surrealists allowed themselves to be guided by their subconscious and the Cubists concentrated on how to depict perspective…
If contemporary art has often been associated withabstractpainting, it cannot in any way be reduced to this association. Figurative art is making a comeback on the current art scene and artists are using the style across the world. Contemporary painting is never static and the artworks shown in these pages are proof.
At Artsper, we offer a large and diverse range of paintings, both modern and contemporary, from the best international art galleries. Explore the themes which have fascinated renowned contemporary painters and young artists and discoverlandscape paintings, portraits,still lives,nudesand from numerous artistic movements such as Pop art, Street art orOutsider Art…

Li Baoxun,https://www.artsper.com/us/contemporary-artists/china/43/li-baoxun,"Li Baoxun
































Every brushstroke is a potent spell.
Li Baoxun is a Chinese artist born in 1983. He lives and works currently in China.
The implementation of Li Baoxun finger tip the contrast between a dream world and a world lived.
On backdrop, parcels of ancestral landscapes beautifully painted call the well-being, to the fullness. The colors are pastel, almost erased for better lead us in the field of the thought, of the memory, of a happiness forgotten.
Always outside, he sometimes we dive into idyllic landscapes of mountains, plains, fields. It privileged however the aquatic scenes, streams, rivers, waterfalls, the return to the liquid element.
In the first plan, totally offset, often the same character to the dyed pink, wearing glasses, tie and black suit, returns. It is framework, leader, business man and power. Between two waters or well sometimes immersed, his attitudes reflect the questioning of modern man on the feeding frenzy and the pace imposed by the current company. He seeks, he questioned him, he tried to reposition themselves, it marked a pause. It is the return to the source, to the original. But, the difference of situation is not so great, that this immersion in the dream, the sometimes leads to suffocation or drowning?
Li Baoxun is a young painter of talent in full become. His canvases painted in the oil have already been hung in China next to the largest (Zhang Xiaogang, Zao Wou-ki, Zhou chunya ... ).

Art is not a matter of young or old, it is a matter of passion above all.
German painter, photographer andsculptorPeter Klasen was born in Lübeck in 1935.
Peter Klasen grew up in a family sensitive to the arts: his uncle Karl Christian Klasen, a student of Otto Dix, was a landscape and portrait expressionist painter and his grand-father, a philanthropist and art collector, introduced him to many painters who were friends of their family. Peter Klasen started drawing and paining at a very young age. He learns the techniques oflithographyand the airbrushing. He reads Dostoyevsky, Kafka and Thomas Mann and he is touched by their books.
Industrial themes mark his work. one can discover in hispaintingselements such as pressure gauges, metal locks, tarpaulin sheets for trucks and cars, hoses for hydraulic circuits. Logos, numbers and pictures from magazines or posters are also present in his paintings.
A master of contrast, he is fascinated by the hostility of the modern city and by the representations of the body as merchandise.
Peter Klasen has recently started to produce prints, and thus the new figuration or the narrative figuration have entered the Lacan collection, adding to its diversity. We can discover the artist's interest in our society in his aquagravures. Industrial themes, body image, objects of consumption, advertisements, vehicles paintings etc - they all meet in his works that becomes a critical reflection of our social environment.

Salvador Dalí,https://www.artsper.com/us/contemporary-artists/spain/1462/salvador-dali,"Salvador Dali
























































































































The difference between the surrealists and me is that I am surrealist.
Salvador Dalí, in full Salvador Felipe Jacinto Dalí y Domenech, was born May 11, 1904, in Figueras,Spain, and died on January 23, 1989. This Spanishsurrealistpainter and printmaker was known for his explorations of subconscious imagery.

As an art student in Madrid and Barcelona, Dalí absorbed a number of artistic styles and displayed unusual technical dexterity as a painter. It was not until the late 1920s that two events brought about the development of his mature artistic style. First, his discovery of Sigmund Freud's writings on the erotic significance of subconscious imagery. Second, his affiliation with the ParisSurrealists, a group of artists and writers who sought to establish a “greater reality"" of the human subconscious over reason. To evoke images from his subconscious mind,Dalípartook in self-induced hallucinatory states, a process he described as “paranoiac-critical"".

Upon Dalí establishing this method, his painting style matured at an extraordinary rate. Thanks toRene MagritteandJoan Miró, from 1929 to 1937, Dalí had produced the artworks that had earned him the title of the world's best-known Surrealist artist. He depicted a dream world in which commonplace objects are juxtaposed, deformed, or otherwise metamorphosed in a bizarre and irrational manner.

The famous artist dabbled in other media as well. Alongside Spanish director Luis Buñuel, Dalí made two Surrealist films—Un Chien Andalou (1928; An Andalusian Dog) and L'Âge d'Or (1930; The Golden Age)—that are similarly filled with grotesque but highly suggestive images. Dalí also wrote books; perhaps the most interesting and revealing being The Secret Life of Salvador Dalí (1942-44).

By the late 1930s, Dalí switched to painting in a more academic style under the influence of the Renaissance painter Raphael. By doing so, he was consequently expelled from the Surrealist movement. Thereafter, he spent much of his time designing theatre sets, fashionable shop interiors, jewelry, as well as exhibiting his genius for flamboyant self-promotional stunts in the United States, where he lived from 1940 to 1955.

From 1950 to 1970, Dalí painted many works with religious themes, although he continued to explore erotic subjects, childhood memories, and themes surrounding his wife, Gala. Despite their technical accomplishments, Dalí's later paintings are not as highly regarded as his earlier works.

Sonia Delaunay,https://www.artsper.com/us/contemporary-artists/ukraine/3344/sonia-delaunay,"Sonia Delaunay


























































































Art is a spontaneous manifestation of the human being through their sensitivity to colors.
Sonia Delaunay was a Ukrainian painter born on November 14, 1885.
With her husbandRobert Delaunay, they developed their own concept of abstraction as a universal language.
Sonia Delaunay went even further by developing this concept in different media. The 1930s saw the blossoming of a refinedabstraction, characteristic of the international style.
After the war, Sonia Delaunay's paintings underwent a profound renewal that led, at the end of the 1960s, to an intensely poetic abstract art. Her formal and technical creativity was then expressed in monumental works in painting, mosaic, carpet and tapestry.

Henri Matisse,https://www.artsper.com/us/contemporary-artists/france/2639/henri-matisse,"Henri Matisse








































Creativity takes courage.
Henri Matisse, in full Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse (born December 31, 1869, Le Cateau, Picardy, France - died November 3, 1954, Nice) is an artist often regarded as the most important French painter of the 20th century. The leader of the Fauvist movement around 1900, Matisse pursued the expressiveness of colour throughout his career. His subjects were largely domestic or figurative, and a distinct Mediterranean verve presides in the treatment.
Matisse, whose parents were in the grain business, displayed little interest in art until he was 20 years old. From 1882 to 1887 he attended the secondary school in Saint-Quentin; after a year of legal studies in Paris, he returned to Saint-Quentin and became a clerk in a law office. He began to sit in on an early-morning drawing class at the local École Quentin-Latour, and, in 1890, while recovering from a severe attack of appendicitis, he began to paint, at first copying the coloured reproductions in a box of oils his mother had given him. In 1891 he abandoned the law and returned to Paris to become a professional artist.
Although at this period he had, in his own words, “hair like Absalom's,"" he was far from being a typical Left Bank bohemian art student. The 19th-century gospel of work, derived from a middle class, northern French upbringing, was to mark his entire career, and soon it was accompanied by a thoroughly bourgeois appearance—gold-rimmed spectacles; short, carefully trimmed beard; plump, feline body; conservative clothes—which was odd for a leading member of the Parisian avant-garde.
Matisse did not, however, become a member of the avant-garde right away. In 1891, in order to prepare himself for the entrance examination at the official École des Beaux-Arts, he enrolled in the privately run Académie Julian, where the master was the strictly academic William-Adolphe Bouguereau, then at the peak of a since-departed fame as a painter of bevies of naked, mildly provocative nymphs. ThatMatisseshould have begun his studies in such a school may seem surprising, and he once explained the fact by saying that he was acting on the recommendation of a Saint-Quentin painter of hens and poultry yards. But it must be remembered that he himself was for the moment a provincial with tastes that were old-fashioned in a Paris already familiar with the Post-Impressionism of Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, and Vincent van Gogh. His earliest canvases are in the 17th-century Dutch manner favoured by the French Realists of the 1850s.
In 1892 he left the Académie Julian for evening classes at the École des Arts Décoratifs and for the atelier of the Symbolist painter Gustave Moreau at the École des Beaux-Arts, without being required to take the entrance examination. Matisse continued, with some long interruptions, to study in the atelier until 1899, when he was forced to leave by Fernand Cormon, an intolerant painter who had become the professor after Moreau's death. After that, although he was nearing 30, he frequented for a time a private academy where intermittent instruction was given by the portraitist Eugène Carrière.
In 1896 Matisse exhibited four paintings at the backward-looking Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts and scored a triumph; he was elected an associate member of the Salon society, and his Woman Reading (1894) was purchased by the government. From this point onward he became increasingly confident and venturesome, both as an artist and as a man. During the next two years he undertook expeditions to Brittany, met the veteran Impressionist Camille Pissarro, and discovered the series of Impressionist masterpieces in the Gustave Caillebotte Collection, which had just been donated—amid protests from conservatives—to the French nation. His colours became, for a while, lighter in hue and at the same time more intense. In 1897 he took his first major step toward stylistic liberation and created a minor scandal at the Salon with The Dinner Table (La Desserte), in which he combined a Renoir kind of luminosity with a firmly classical composition in deep red and green.
In 1898 he married a young woman from Toulouse, Amélie Parayre, and left Paris for a year, visiting London, where he studied the paintings of J.M.W. Turner, and working in Corsica, where he received a lasting impression of Mediterranean sunlight and colour.He became interested in the Pointillist idea of obtaining additive mixtures of colour on the retina by means of juxtaposed dots (points in French) on the canvas.
He purchased from Vollard the plaster model of the bust of Henri Rochefort by Auguste Rodin, and during 1899 he began to attend an evening class in sculpture. His early work in three dimensions, the first of some 60 pieces he executed during his lifetime, reveals the influence not only of Rodin but also of Antoine-Louis Barye, generally considered the greatest French sculptor of animals.
After 1899 he ceased to exhibit at the Salon and gradually became a familiar figure in the Parisian circles where modern art was being produced and ardently discussed. In 1901 he showed for the first time in the juryless, eclectic Salon des Indépendants, which had been founded in 1884 as a refuge for painters unacceptable to the official exhibition juries. In 1902 he was in a group show at the small gallery of Berthe Weill, and the next year he and a number of his old classmates from Moreau's atelier and the Académie Carrière were the progressive contingent in the liberal, newly created Salon d'Automne. But in spite of such recognition, he was often on the brink of financial disaster. In 1900 he was obliged to accept work on the decoration of the Grand Palais, which was being erected to house part of the new Exposition Universelle in the Champs-Élysées quarter. He was past 34 when, in June 1904, at Vollard's gallery, he had his first one-man show, and it was a failure.
He spent the summer of 1905 with André Derain at Collioure, a small French fishing port on the Mediterranean, near the Spanish border. In the dazzling sunshine he rapidly freed himself from what he called “the tyranny"" of Pointillism. The carefully placed little dabs required by the additive-mixture approach turned into swirls and slabs of spontaneous brushwork, and the theoretically realistic colours exploded into an emotional display of complementaries: red against green, orange against blue, and yellow against violet. Representative of this new freedom were Open Window, which was finished at Collioure, and Woman with the Hat, a portrait of his wife painted back in Paris in September. That fall, the two pictures were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne alongside works by a number of artists who also had been experimenting with violent colour. The Paris critic Louis Vauxcelles called the group les fauves (“the wild beasts""), and thus Fauvism, the first of the important “isms"" in 20th-century painting, was born. Almost immediately Matisse became its acknowledged leader.
The Stein family in Paris—Gertrude, her brothers Leo and Michael, and the latter's wife, Sarah—became Matisse collectors. In 1906 the artist had a show at the Galerie Druet in Paris in addition to exhibiting again at the Salons des Indépendants and d'Automne. In 1908 he exhibited in New York City, Moscow, and Berlin.
Fauvism was too undisciplined to last long, and soon its adherents were moving, according to their temperaments, toward Expressionism, Cubism, or some kind of neo-traditionalism. Matisse had no liking for these directions, and if “Fauve"" is taken to mean simply a painter with a passion for pure colour, he can be said to have remained one all his life. He had, however, too much rationalism in his outlook not to wish for some order in a stylistic situation that threatened to become chaotic, and his search for chromatic equilibrium and linear economy can be followed in a series of major works produced between the revelation of Fauvism in 1905 and the end of World War I. In 1906 he painted Joy of Life; in 1908, The Dessert, a Harmony in Red; in 1911, The Red Studio; in 1915, Goldfish; in 1916, Piano Lesson; and in 1918, Montalban, Large Landscape.
Matisse had been interested in etching, drypoint, lithography, and allied printmaking techniques since his first years in Paris and had produced a number of occasional prints. In 1932 he had published, as illustrations for an edition of Stéphane Mallarmé's Poésies, 29 etchings, in which his talent for supple contours and linear economy was subtly attuned to the “purity of means"" evident in the poems. After the outbreak of World War II, he became increasingly active as a graphic artist. He illustrated numerous books and published Jazz (1947), a book consisting of his own reflections on art and life, with brilliantly coloured illustrations made by a technique he called “drawing with scissors"": the motifs were pasted together after being cut out of sheets of coloured paper (hand-painted with gouache in order to get the desired hue).
During the last years of his life, he was a rather solitary man who was separated from his wife and whose grownup children were scattered. After 1941, when he underwent an operation for an intestinal disorder, he was bedridden much of the time; after 1950 he suffered from asthma and heart trouble. Often he was obliged to work on his mural-sized projects from a studio bed with the aid of a crayon attached to a long pole. But there are no signs of flagging creative energy or of sadness in his final achievements; on the contrary, these works are among the most daring, most accomplished, and most serenely optimistic of his entire career.
Matisse considered the peak of his life-work to be his design and decoration of the Chapel of the Rosary for the Dominican nuns at Vence, France (1948–1951). He designed the black-and-white tile pictures, stained glass, altar crucifix, and vestments (ceremonial robes). At the time of the consecration (declaration of sacredness) of the Vence chapel, Matisse held a large retrospective exhibition (a look back at the work he created) in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.
The ultimate step in the art of Matisse was taken in his papiers découpés, abstract cutouts in colored paper, executed in the mid-1940s, for example, the Negro Boxer, Tristesse du roi, and Jazz. The master died on November 3, 1954, in Cimiez, France, near Nice.
