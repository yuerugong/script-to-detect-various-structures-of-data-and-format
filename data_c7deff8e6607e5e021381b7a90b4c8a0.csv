He initiated and curated exhibitions and site-specific public commissions that breached institutional boundaries, and reached wider and more diverse publics: either by intervening in the interface between the private and the public realms; by proposing experimental formats that generate flows between the exhibition space and other locations in the city; by engendering strategies that allow for a critical interaction with a wide range of publics, among others.Currently in the Netherlands, he expanded his interest in exploring the co-defining relation between the social and spatial dynamics shaping our urban environments towards a wider understating encompassing the natural environment and its relation to the ongoing socio-ecological crisis. Leading the artistic programme of the Jan van Eyck Academie, he has curated a wide breadth of programmes which fostered urgent debates and promoted crossovers between the arts, the social and natural sciences, policymaking, among other fields, through formats experimenting with the physical and digital/online realms.Bruno is an alumnus of the De Appel Curatorial Programme, Amsterdam (2018/19).

Photographic self-portraiture, collaboration, and space making intersect in the interpretation and dissemination of their experience coming home to their body and the world as a trans-masculine queer immigrant. By reconsidering the right to look; they renegotiate the contract between photographer, sitter and viewer, here the paradoxes of representation, access, and privacy collide.

Kai Barrow,https://curatorsintl.org/about/collaborators/7401-kai-barrow,"Kai Lumumba Barrow is the founder of Gallery of the Streets in New Orleans. For over 35 years her work has been grounded in efforts to end structural oppression and state violence. Her work intersects theories and practices that transgress the borders of the arts, academic, and organizing worlds. Barrow is a co-founder of Critical Resistance, a national grassroots organization to end the prison industrial complex, and currently sits on the Community Advisory Board. She has also worked with national, regional, and local organizations to coordinate and design convenings, trainings, mass mobilizations, nonviolent direct actions, and guerrilla theatre. She has campaigned to stop jail expansion; confront police violence; reveal prosecutorial misconduct; bring visibility to women prisoners, political prisoners, and people confined to control units; interrupt gender discrimination and bias within prisons, policing, and sentencing; challenge the human rights abuses of prisoners, former prisoners and their family members, and experiment with decarceration models for shrinking the system. As an artist, she is drawn to surrealism as a movement that, according to Robin D.G. Kelley, “invites dreaming, urges us to improvise and invent, and recognizes the imagination as our most powerful weapon.” In 2010, she formed Gallery of the Streets to “engage everyday spaces as sites of resistance.” An evolving national network of artists, activists, organizers, scholars, cultural workers, and community supporters, its signature program, visual opera, fuses public art and community engagement to confront power, provoke dialogue, and cultivate sustainable spaces. They identify points of intervention and create site-specific installations, and sound, movement, and visual compositions that are organized and performed in traditional and non-traditional spaces. They believe that art is an invitation for dialogue and can shift our ideas and our practices.

Yane Calovski,https://curatorsintl.org/about/collaborators/4676-yane-calovski,"
Yane Calovski’s artistic practice is research-based and interdisciplinary. He is interested in reactivating and linking existing, inconclusive modernist narratives and how these, as evocations, can stimulate a new critical imagination. His perception of a subject is almost always relational and contextual. Visually, he articulates his work by examining the discursive traces in archives that emerge from the absorption and assimilation of information. The nonlinearity of collective memory informs his practice as he researches and conducts fieldwork over long periods. He assembles found materials from various archives, questioning how history is practiced, produced, presented, and consumed. Through writing, drawing, video, and installations, he processes information, actions, and the remnants of previous research embodying elusive and concrete themes that sometimes overlap, then reappear. This methodology results in works that demarcate the installation concept towards architectural constructions informed by the spatial and contextual specificity of the site, the visual value of the material, and the conceptual elasticity of the form. Calovski has participated in numerous group shows, including exhibitions at the MAXXI (2021), Guangdong Museum of Art (2017), Pera Museum (2016), Malmö Konstmuseum (2015), Künstlerhaus Bethanien (2015), Kunsthalle Bregenz (2013), Kunsthallen Brands (2006), Arcadia University Art Gallery (2004), CAC Vilnius (2003), Drawing Center (1998), as well as the 39th EVA International Biennial (2020), Helsinki Photography Biennial (2014), Qalandiya International VII: FRACTURES (2014), 2nd Biennial D-0 ARK Underground (2012), Manifesta 7 (2008), and Manifesta 3 (2000). His site-specific installations have been featured as part ofArchives and Realityat Kunsthalle im Lipsiusbau, Dresden (2019),All Mounds Can Be Seen From My Windowat Bunkier Sztuki, Krakow (2016), andHaushalten, at the Stiftung Bauhaus, Dessau (2015).

Hassan Darsi,https://curatorsintl.org/about/collaborators/6736-hassan-darsi,"Hassan Darsi’s artistic practice is strongly infused with his experiences, his daily life, and his environment, which manifests in his process, through multiple mediums and often in the form of participatory projects. In 1995 he founded the project La Source du Lion in Casablanca. In 1999 Darsi began developing work on and with gilding, using golden adhesive as his material of choice for covering objects—dolls, a garden chair, a television, tanks, teeth…but also public spaces, including, notably, the façade of an art gallery in Casablanca in 2007, the concrete blocks of the pier on the port of Guia de Isora in Tenerife in 2008 and those on the port of Marseille in 2012. In 2001, he started the series “Portraits de famille” in which, from 2001 to 2007, the inhabitants of seven cities around the world were invited to pose in his mobile studio. The Hermitage Park project, developed in the form of “artistic bridges” from 2002 to 2008, marked the beginning of a series of actions and projects engaged with questions about the city, architecture and public spaces: “Le lion se meurt,” “Le passage de la modernité,” “Le square d’en bas,” “Point zéro,” “Le toit du monde,” “Chantiers en or”… Along with these projects, he has participated in numerous international exhibitions in art centers, museums and biennales. His works have been the subject of several studies and publications throughout the world, and are in numerous public and private collections in Morocco and abroad.

Serena JV Elston
Serena JV Elston is a transdisciplinary curator and sculptor contemplating the body and its relationship to structures of power. Her research-based practice explores ecology, posthumanism, disability, and embodiment through a post-colonial lens. At its core, her practice asks, if an institution has the power to disable a body, does the body have the power to disable an institution? Grappling with the identity of disability, she depicts figures in various stages of decomposition and incompleteness. Her work seeks to make visible the precarious materiality of structures to reveal them as inherently temporal.
Serena’s background in architecture and production has been instrumental in the creation of ambitious curatorial projects such as SPACORE—a platform centered around lived experiences within wellness capitalism—and Siren Island, a floating stage reimagining land mythologies through live theater events on the open water. Her work has been exhibited both in the United States and internationally, including at Ever Gold [Projects] in San Francisco, VideoDrome Paris, S.O.F.A. Italy, G99 in Brno, CZ and the MOAH Museum in Lancaster, California. Serena was a finalist for the 2024 Joan Mitchell Fellowship and a recipient of the 2024 City of Chicago (DCASE) Individual Artist Grant, 2024 ArtsMidwest Award for Artists with Disabilities, and an awardee of the 2024 3Arts Ignite Fund.

Also nearing completion is a short book, entitled “Uptake,” on ego, otherness, and habit (‘method’) in intellectual work with art; its argument grows from reflections on teaching in both art history and studio settings; pandemic alienations; and the world-work engaged art writing might seek to do.
His book-length publications include seven titles. Four are monographs:Charles Ray: Adam and Eve(Gregory R. Miller and Co., forthcoming September 2023);To Describe a Life: Notes from the Intersection of Art and Race Terror(Yale, 2019), 1971:A Year in the Life of Color(University of Chicago, 2016), andHow to See a Work of Art in Total Darkness(MIT, 2007).

She sits on the 2024 selection panel for the disabled-led commissioning organisation Unlimited, and has served on the board of the Art Fund, the UK’s national charity for art, since 2020.
Notable exhibition projects includeThe Enchanted Interior, which foregrounded feminist artists’ ripostes to art history’s sinister fascination with trapped women;Exploding Collage, an experimental artist-led project which reckoned with how to ‘exhibit’ artworks that no longer exist due to biases in histories of collecting;Modern Visionaries: Van Dyck and the Artist’s Eye(in partnership with the National Portrait Gallery, London), which challenged gendered myths about artistic genius; andEllen Gallagher | Francis Bacon.

Grace Samboh (b. Jakarta) lives and works either in Yogyakarta, Jakarta, or wherever her friends are. She is in search of what comprises a curatorial work within her surrounding scene. She jigs within the existing elements of the arts scene around her for she considers the claim that Indonesia is lacking art infrastructure especially the state-owned or state run as something outdated. She believes that curating is about understanding and making at the same time. With Hyphen — (f. 2011), her concern is to encourage Indonesian arts and artistic research projects and publications. Her research looks at contemporary practices outside the existing centers of the Indonesian art scene and slowly reconnects them all with the past and central narratives. With Enin Supriyanto, Yustina Neni & Ratna Mufida, she used to run Equator Symposium (Yogyakarta Biennale Foundation, 2010-2018) where they explored the possibility of connecting equatorial countries through current life situation with an admiration to the past and optimism towards the future. In 2019, she joined a gallery-based initiative in Jakarta, RUBANAH Underground Hub.
Her recent endeavors are “Jakarta Biennale 2021: ESOK”; “Collecting Entanglements and Embodied Histories” a joint venture between Galeri Nasional Indonesia, MAIIAM Contemporary Art Museum, Singapore Art Museum, Nationalgalerie – Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, and Goethe-Institut (2021-2022); “Rewinding Internationalism: Scenes from the 1990s, today” organised by L’Internationale, and Van Abbemuseum (2022-2023), “Color Curtain and the Promise of Bandung” a series of roundtables reappraising Asian-African political imagination (2020-ongoing), and “Jejaring, Rimpang” in Pekan Kebudayaan Nasional 2023 (National Culture Week), Indonesia.

WHW organizes a range of production, exhibition, and publishing projects and since 2003 has been directing city-owned Gallery Nova in Zagreb. “What?,” “How?,” and “For whom?” are the three basic questions of every economic organization, and are fundamental to the planning, conception, and realization of exhibitions and the production and distribution of artworks and the artist’s position in the labor market. These questions formed the title of WHW’s first project, in 2000 in Zagreb, dedicated to the 152nd anniversary of the Communist Manifesto, and became the motto of WHW’s work and the name of their collective. Other exhibitions they have curated includeBroadcasting Project, dedicated to Nikola Teslaat the Technical Museum, Zagreb (2002),Looking Awryat Apexart, New York (2003),Side-effectsat the Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade (2004),Normalizationat Gallery Nova, Zagreb (2004),Collective Creativityat Kunsthalle Fridericianum, Kassel (2005),Final Exhibitionat Galerija Nova, Zagreb (2006), and the 11thIstanbul Biennial(2009).

With an artist background to me art means working with inspiration to discover more energy and transformable ideas. Still young in curating realms I am fascinated by design as such my approach is constructive and open. Collaborations and new media practices are my starting point, discharging the energy when it arises in the space where both the artists and the audience are slightly out of their comfort zone. In curating, I explore ways of building blocks with the artists and my audience enabling the spaces to engage the energy captured in the artwork. With the background of being a sculptor the academic side is still in developing, within a young art appreciating community, I find myself immersed in this new term Curating after spending years as an exhibition officer for a National Gallery mandated to research collect preserve and educate. The transformation is somewhat puzzling yet the idea of growth through networking with artists and audiences in local and international spaces inspires the voyage. To this extend I focus on building projects from the design perspective with the artists put in motion by collaborative movements through interdisciplinary practices.",https://curatorsintl.org/images/Zulu_Cliford.jpg?w=1920,data_c7deff8e6607e5e021381b7a90b4c8a0_20240926202940,2024-09-26 20:29:40.607137
