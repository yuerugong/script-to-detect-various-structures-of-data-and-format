232 curators across 38 countries and 27 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico submitted applications for four Fellowship opportunities: Curatorial Research Fellowships for curators of African descent based anywhere in the world and for BIPOC curators based in the United States, both under the Marian Goodman Gallery Initiative in honor of the late Okwui Enwezor; the Indigenous Curatorial Research Fellowship; and the Mississippi River Basin Curatorial Research Fellowship.
ICI’s Curatorial Research Fellowships program reflects the organization’s commitment to the advancement of new knowledge and practices. The program supports curators’ research, travel, and the development of their professional networks, promoting experimentation, collaboration, and international engagement in the field. Conceived to foster independent research, the Fellowships offer a framework tailored to each curator’s field of critical inquiry: Fellows receive mentorship specific to their research interests, as well as $10,000 in financial support. They also have access to ICI’s international networks of collaborators and programs to create opportunities for continued learning.
This year, we are delighted to work with and support the practices of these four curators, whose timely and innovative projects are pushing the curatorial field forward.
Eduardo Carrera (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania):Eduardo Carrera’s research explores LGBTQ+ BIPOC representation and resistance in queer photography from the southern United States, a region intricately linked to Latin America and the Caribbean due to its territorial and cultural proximity. Informed by a selection of work by artists active in the 1970s-80s, through to today – including George Febres, George Dureau, and Judy Cooper, alongside contemporary photographers like Trenity Thomas and Tommy Kha – his Fellowship project examines queer BIPOC experiences and depictions during the HIV/AIDS crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing histories of photography alongside developments in queer culture throughout the American South, Eduardo will mine archives and museum collections. Additionally, he will conduct interviews with curators in order to better understand the integration of queer photography into broader museological narratives of American art history.
Learn more about Eduardo and his project.

Dean Daderko (St. Louis, Missouri):Through deep engagement with the Mississippi River, Dean Daderko seeks to draw literal and metaphoric connections by exploring the cultural and ecological interconnectedness of sites and beings linked by the River and its tributaries. Following their recent arrival in St. Louis, and in a leadership role at a regional institution, Dean will follow the River as a method of research, connecting with cultural producers in places like Des Moines, Memphis, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, Omaha, and beyond, establishing collaborations and building an ecologically-minded relationship among creatives. Their research will inform an upcoming exhibition at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis.
Learn more about Dean and their project.
Jason Garcia (Santa Clara Pueblo, New Mexico):Jason Garcia’s (Okuu Pín/Turtle Mountain) project seeks to raise awareness of Tewa art, culture, and relationship to land through critical engagement with Georgia O’Keeffe’s work and museum, which have long defined the popular imaginary of northern New Mexico and contributed to the erasure of Tewa perspectives. Questioning the Tewa absence from this conception of the landscape and the broader settler colonial context of northern New Mexico, Garcia will bring together a group of Indigenous artists, scholars, and community members to co-curate an exhibition that honors historical and contemporary Tewa contributions to the land and culture of the region. The project comes at a critical time for the Georgia O’Keeffe Museum, which is currently planning for a new campus that will center Indigenous perspectives; participants in the project will spend time with the Museum’s collections and in O’Keeffe’s homes and studios, engaging in collective research and exchange.
Learn more about Jason and his project.

Irlando Ferreira (Mindelo, Cabo Verde):Irlando Ferreira’s research seeks to analyze and document the role of visual art in shaping and affirming the cultural identity of post-independence Cabo Verde; as independence leader Amílcar Cabral wrote, ""The liberation struggle is first and foremost an act of culture."" Focusing on three artists—Manuel Figueira, Luísa Queirós and Bela Duarte, who together formed Cooperativa Resistência or The Collective Resistance—the project will uncover how these creatives’ work to research, preserve, and revitalize Cabo Verdean popular culture in the 1970s laid the foundation for a new aesthetic and political reality in the country. Deeply rooted in Cabo Verde’s complex history as a Portuguese colony and center of the transatlantic slave trade, Irlando’s research will also tie Cabo Verdean narratives to broader discussions across the African continent and Global South.

In 2023, we are thrilled to support the practices of these four curators, whose projects explore diverse and timely topics through rigorous research and innovative curatorial work.
Michelle Mlati (Brussels, Belgium):Michelle Mlati's project continues in-depth research into Sudanese and East African artists associated with The Forest and Desert School, a literary and artistic movement that emerged in Sudan in the 1960s. Documenting, translating, and archiving works produced by affiliated artists, the research will focus on the complex network of African and Arab identities represented in the School and culminate in an exhibition. Mlati will investigate the lineage of creatives who shaped and have been shaped by the School, many of whose works remain untranslated and understudied. The project contributes to a broader effort to bring greater visibility to Sudanese art and literature and builds on Mlati’s previous work, including a 2022 exhibition and research in Uganda and Kenya.
Learn more about Michelle and her project.

Margaret Kross (Pittsburgh, PA):During her Fellowship, Margaret Kross will research artistic strategies of abstraction and conceptual practice in considering the built environment within the Mississippi River Basin. She will focus on artists who, by utilizing these specific strategies, intervene in the fiction that the land is an abstract concept. The project will further her previous research interrogating how “immaterial” land policies and plans have a fundamentally material impact. This particular deep dive will explore how unseen beliefs that shape the built environment in turn shape psychological space. It aims to study how narratives of the land might, likewise, be reimagined and enter collective consciousness through abstract and conceptual gestures embedded in the artwork. Kross is based in Pittsburgh, PA, a city delineated by three rivers, though local lore has long mythologized an unseen “fourth river” beneath the ground. Using the “fourth river” as a conceptual anchor, the project seeks to map a metaphorical relationship between the oppressive materiality of the built environment in the Mississippi Basin region and the materiality of memory, emotion, and narrative.

Margaret Jacobs (Salem, NY):Margaret Jacobs (Akwesasne Mohawk) will develop new research into the various manifestations of kinship in contemporary Indigenous art, including familial connection, mentorship, and collaborative art practice. Aiming to challenge dominant discourses around Indigenous art and creative practice in New England, the project will encompass work by arts families in which traditional practice is taught through generations, as well as new ways of art-making taking place in urban or off-reservation spaces and in the resulting inter-tribal communities. The project will inform and build toward a 2024 exhibition at the Kimball Jenkins School of Art in Concord, New Hampshire, featuring works in a variety of media with an emphasis on rising artists.

Ariana Faye Allensworth (New York, NY):Ariana Faye Allensworth’s research will examine geographies of Black sovereignty and world-building in California. The town of Allensworth, CA, a once Black utopia and the state’s first town founded, financed, and governed by Black Americans, will serve as the basis for her research. Stemming from Allensworth’s family connection to the town’s history, her project will draw from archival research and the work of contemporary artists whose practices engage with the Black geographic imagination and radical placemaking in the West. Culminating in a publication and public art installation, the project seeks to offer expansive and critical narratives of California – and American – landscapes.

Michelle Mlati: 2023 Curatorial Research Fellow,https://curatorsintl.org/learning/22830-2023-fellow-mlati,"The following interview originally appeared inGLEANmagazine in March 2024.
A cradle of bougainvillea amongst a variety of potted understory plants greets you as you enter modernist and contemporary artist Kamala Ibrahim Ishag’s high-rise apartment in Sharjah, where she has set up her new studio. In December 2023, I caught up with the artist and her plants while Ishag transitions from her beloved home country of Sudan to the UAE following the war that broke out in Khartoum in April 2023. Ishag has been based in Sharjah since May 2023. It’s a place she has maintained a working relationship to throughout her six-decade career.
Like many other artists who fled the war, she was only able to take with her the bare minimum of work that was dear to her when she left Sudan. When recalling her brief time in Egypt, where she stayed before coming to Sharjah, we reminisce about the likes of Reem Aljeally and Salah Elmur, a younger generation of Sudanese artists she has mentored, and the Egyptian artist Souad Abdelrassoul, all currently based in Cairo. She humorously notes how some people liken Abdelrassoul’s work to her own, and quickly adds that it’s not true; Abdelrassoul ""has different work and beautiful."" In fact, it is both artists’ deep relationship to plants and humans that is the source of my affinity with their separate practices, each unique in its own way. The reference to plants in Kamala’s own work makes her remember the beautiful garden that she left behind in Sudan. She expresses:
""It’s not a very large garden, just plants, like flowers. I have so many colors of flowers. Sometimes when I look at them, I almost cry because I miss them. I say, 'are you still alive?’ I know they are not because there is no watering… One of my assistants said, no, this is winter and when the rainy season comes they’ll be alive. I said no, that will harm them because it’s very hard rain. The flowers, they won’t be alive.""
Although it is currently winter in Sudan, she notes that the winters there are the same as in Emirates, a gentler warmth of 20°C in comparison to the extreme summers.

Michelle Mlati:It was heartbreaking to learn that you had to abandon your studio in Sudan. I wanted to understand more about the Forest and Desert School, the literary school. But I also wanted to understand its connection to art. That’s the reason I wanted to come and learn from you and about how you have been working with it in your art. Was your connection to the school direct or indirect?
Kamala Ishag:It’s more indirect because when I worked in my practice, I wasn’t always in Sudan. The work got classified as if it were part of this group…It’s not that we would always gather and start working together even when I was there.
MM:I understand that, because this whole exhibition [The Forest and Desert School Revisited] was a way for me to revisit the school and understand its conceptual elements, but also to elaborate and add more to it through experimentation. So, you had your own ideas?
KI:Yes, everyone had their own ideas that he or she liked…but people classified them all into one group.
MM:But how come, then, that the group associated with the visual arts was called the Khartoum School and the group associated with literature the Forest and Desert School?
KI:This is different. Khartoum School was the name when I was a student, that was in the late 60s. We had a teacher for history, he was British or British American or something like that, he used to come to the school and he worked in Sudan for some time in the history department. When he was leaving, he called it the Khartoum School. This is how it got the name. And he said that this was for our teachers, the older generation, I mean older than me.
MM:This was Ahmed Shibrain, among others?
KI:Yes, Shibrain, El Salahi, Rabbah—this group—he said that this was the Khartoum School. Because I was almost the first. There were some teachers from the Ministry of Education who came to the college just for training. They did art for the secondary school and taught. But as a student, I was one of the first to go to the art school in Khartoum. He called me along with the group of El Salahi, Shibrain, and Rabbah, the old generation, he called us the Khartoum School. Not because they all worked the same, although most of them did, like the old Arabic calligraphy—have you seen some of the work? Except me.
MM:Yes, like the work of Mohamed Otaybi?
KI:Yes, but I was the first to just do relatively modernist painting, if you can call it that. I didn’t use the Arabic calligraphy in the way they used to, most of the older generation. But because I was one of the first painters in the school, they needed to find someone among them. That is how they just put me in the Khartoum School. I wasn’t in the Khartoum School because they have another stream of painting. I just didn’t use the Arabic calligraphy in my paintings, which they did. I just painted modernist-like paintings. Like when I came to England, I got so possessed by William Blake in the Tate gallery while studying at the Royal Academy of Art in the 60s. I used to go every weekend and spend the day there.
MM:And from that collection, was there something that inspired you in your work?
KI:Everything inspired me in England...I really loved England very much.
MM:Would you want to go back and live there?
KI:Live? No. I already live in Sudan. Now, I’m staying here in the United Arab Emirates, but I won’t live here forever. I hope not.
MM:Sudan is your home?
KI:Sudan is my country. It isn’t only my country, and my area, and my house, it is where I would like to be living when I go. Inshallah.
MM:I hope that you will go back.
KI:Sometimes I remember the house.
MM:Can you describe some of the works that you left behind?
KI:I left them in the studio, I think about them every minute of the day.
MM:And do you remember the last thing you painted before you left?
KI:I had like six or seven works, murals if I remember, different sizes. They start from 2.5 meters by 2 meters, as the canvas I cut is 2 meters wide, and then I painted on it and then stretched it. I had six or seven; I had to put them all around the studio. The largest painting was 4.5 meters by 2 meters. I vaguely remember it when I was there because I wanted to do some touches, every time I remember what I had to do.
MM:What was the subject matter of these works?
KI:It’s always abstract. Figurative abstraction, that’s what I do. It’s very sad. I can lose everything you know, but not my work.
Michelle Mlati,Kamala's Garden (Sharjah, 2023), 2023.
MM:The whole exhibition that I curated at Circle Art Gallery in Nairobi in 2022 was a way for me to deepen my understanding of the conceptual underpinnings of the Forest and Desert School, while expanding the idea of what the School was and could be. I wanted to resist the conventional associations of the forest with African identity and the desert with Arab identity that the first poets had established...Like others, I thought, 'No, it can be both,' but it can also be that the African component is the desert and the Arab component is the forest, and that these associations could be mixed in the poetry of the School.
KI:Yes, it was associated more with poetry in literature than with art. But nowadays, most of the poets are associating it with art. Actually, before, there was one group of artists and literary people, as one union. Then, for some time I went to England and when I came back, I found that the artists and the writers had separated into their own groups, into a union of artists and a union of writers. So, in response I asked why they had separated, what happened?
I understood that those who were part of the literary union used different ways of expressing themselves, and I mean different from the artists. This is because artists don’t necessarily use written language, they make actual work in different mediums beyond the written form. That’s why I think they each had their own union. But the relation between the artists and the writers continued to exist because all the very famous poets were friends of ours, and I remember they used to come to the college when I was teaching there, in my studio or in my office. It was a large office, but they all gathered in there, and they would start talking and arguing...We discussed art and literature, what brings them together, discussions about all our work and everything.
MM:Were there ever any discussions about color with the poets?
KI:They spoke about literature, and we spoke about color and composition and things like that. But they offered their own ideas about our work, and we gave our ideas about their work. It was always a good friendship between the union of artists and writers when it was one union, as it was for some time. I said that it is very strange that the unions separated. I had a friend in Sudan and I asked, Why are you separating your living—
MM:Yes, like separating the functions or making departments, compartmentalizing everything into different fields...But I think what you are saying, perhaps, also goes back to how they started to define the Forest and Desert School as a school of literature and the Khartoum School as an art school.
KI:Yes.
MM:But then, it was actually difficult to know which ideas in literature influenced the painting, and in which way, and how ideas in painting maybe even influenced the poets.
KI:Like who affected whom …
MM:Yes, exactly, it’s not clear in both Schools’ evolutions...and perhaps it goes back to what you said about the artists and the literature union as a single entity. I was also trying to analyse this in relation to the different concepts that exist in your own practice as it is articulated through Crystalism, the postmodern style that you developed with the Crystalist group, which included some of your students. The group also included the students who signedthe 1976 Crystalist Manifesto, which advocated an aesthetic of transparency amongst other elements of it discussing poetry.
KI:You won’t find a clear answer because we think we affected them. Because for us, you can see and not only read because we paint the words of art. You can see it if you put it on the wall or in an exhibition. But with writing, you have to go and find a book and you have to read it. But seeing is more effective, sight is more effective. You don’t forget somebody you saw.
MM:And it’s also more accessible to different people in terms of understanding—
KI:Yes, and the beauty with artwork is that it’s a lot more direct than reading poetry. You can read poetry and not necessarily forget it, but it won’t be in your eyes always.
MM:True, it won’t be in your eyes, but sometimes, while reading some Sudanese poetry, I have a comparable experience. There were only two women writers included in the bookModern Sudanese Poetry: An Anthology(2019); one of them, the poet Rugaia Warrag, once described a teardrop on the verge of freezing in a poem calledA Frosted Cry. I find that the way she uses words to make us see the picture of the ice crystal through the snow in our minds, evoking the image of ice freezing through her diction, could be considered a form of ""literary painting,"" in which she draws on her experience in the diaspora and of being in a kind of exile.
KI:Yes, I see.
MM:Right now, how would you describe your way of working here in Sharjah?
KI:It’s only acrylic and watercolors, but that’s not always my way of working. I work on big canvases; I work in oil and in acrylic sometimes, whereas usually I always work in oil. Except here I cannot work in oil because I don’t have the patience like in Sudan to wait until it is dry and to add another layer. Here, I just do everything quickly, it will dry after a few minutes, the very small ones quicker than the bigger.
MM:The pieces of yours I included in the exhibitionThe Forest and Desert School Revisitedin Nairobi were small. Works from the 70s onwards. So I think scale and size also play an important role in your practice.
KI:Yes, I work on all sizes, but I prefer the large ones.
MM:In some of your works on paper, the paper seems almost transparent. Is this the paper or do you paint those layers of opacity?
KI: It is paint, sometimes I make a painting this way to make it seem as if it is transparent. It is on the paper, not the paper.
MM:Do you use acrylic, watercolors or ink?
KI:Sometimes I use acrylic and ink together. I don’t remember which one I usually apply first. I still paint, but always trees. I always say I’m like a tree.
MM:You always say you’re like a tree?
KI:Yes, like a tree from its roots...
MM:I see you have some plants here on your balcony.
KI:Yes, I have to, if I didn’t have plants I wouldn’t live here.
MM:I was about to say, because the landscape here is more like desert, so there aren’t many trees.
KI:One day, as I told my grandchild, one day we drove two hours...to get these plants.
MM:That’s quite far out. Who planted this?
KI:My granddaughter. When I was in Sudan, I had seven colours of this in my garden (referring to the bougainvillea). Different colours, white, yellow, beige, pink, coral...
MM:And this round one, like the others—why do you have an affinity to paint round figures or on round surfaces
KI:Recently I started painting in that shape, I think when it wasmy London exhibition at Serpentine. There was a round painting.
MM:And when you use the calabash as a painting surface, like these four on the table, what kind of paint do you use?
KI:The acrylic sometimes...
MM:And you’re also working with the charcoal here?
KI:This is one drawing I started...I think it was my state of mind.
MM:There is this sort of sense of displacement in the drawing, which is a self-portrait in progress...and also a sense of loss.
KI:Yes... (somber tone)
Kamala's calabash, 2023. (Photo: Michelle Mlati)
MM:And do you see this as a kind of reflection on yourself? Do you see yourself as a subject?
KI:Yes… (again, in a somber tone) It’s like a cutting off of roots. It feels like I have been cut to pieces now.
MM:Of course, it’s your whole life. This is evident in the way that the hair waves in the picture appear as roots that have been uprooted.
KI:But now, all my paintings are withthe Sharjah Foundationafter the London exhibition. Then they asked me, 'Do you want us to send you all your work to Sudan?' before the war happened. I said no because, as I said already, I am still coming back to Sharjah, and then we can decide together. Thank goodness I didn’t agree to them sending the work to me because if they did, it might never have arrived.
MM:A part of your work you have been able to save, at least. And how many years has it been since you had the 100-square-meter studio in Sudan?
KI:Maybe like seven years ago—there are twoneem trees(Azadirachta indica). One was in front and the other at the back of the house, so I would always say the trees are guarding us.
MM:That’s beautiful. Since you work in figurative abstraction, did your creative inspiration come from being in Sudan, or being in London, or being here in the UAE? Have these three places always influenced your work?
KI:Yes, yes, I just miss my studio. But I always say this, plants and people, they came from one source. The two things are together always. We eat plants and die and then the plants live on our remains. I mean it is a circle between plants and humans forever, because they cannot live without a source of nourishing from the ground. We’re fertilizer, and that is why I like plants and people in my paintings.

Echoes and Shiftsopened on June 13 and 14 and runs through August 23, 2024 atPositive Street Artand theManchester Chamber Galleryin Nashua and Manchester, New Hampshire. The exhibiting artists are:Erin Lee Antonak (Oneida),Katrina Brown Akootchook (Oneida Nations of the Thames),Ansley Hill (Akwesasne Mohawk),Carrie Hill (Akwesasne Mohawk),Margaret Jacobs (Akwesasne Mohawk),George Longfish (Seneca/Tuscarora),Niio Perkins (Akwesasne Mohawk),Roger Sosakete Perkins (Akwesasne Mohawk),Marjorie Kaniehtonkie Skidders (Akwesasne Mohawk)andKaiahtenhtas Thompson (Akwesasne Mohawk).
My proposal for my 2023 ICI Fellowship research was broad—my intent was to research and create an exhibition of work by Indigenous artists that explores the meaning of kinship through ways of mentorship, familial connection, and collaborative art practice. As an artist, educator, and independent curator, I have always been struck by the way we can immediately step back into familiarity with found kin when traveling. This, alongside the extensive amount of artist families that exist within Indigenous communities, became the driving force of my proposal: I wanted to look at kinship from all angles and explore how it impacts contemporary Native art.
Through this research, one of my primary goals was to help further and challenge the discourse around Native artwork in the New England region by putting forth Indigenous artists who are taking traditional forms of art-making and using them to enact contemporary aesthetics and conceptual themes. Showcasing work of this kind is an important part of my personal curatorial approach because it helps to break stereotypes and misconceptions about Native peoples and what constitutes Native artwork. As an artist myself, I create work that exists in an area that one may not consider to be Native artwork upon first glance; after sitting with the work, however, one can see the narrative layers of culture and history embedded within it. In spring 2023, my fellowship goal coincided serendipitously with an opportunity to curate an exhibition of work by Indigenous artists that would take place in summer 2024 in Concord, New Hampshire. The opportunity was presented byYasamin Safarzadeh—curator, cross-cultural liaison, and artist—who was open and receptive to any type of program I wanted to build.
My ICI fellowship research entailed national travel that began closer to home, including visits to the Ganondagan State Historic Site in Victor, New York and the Eiteljorg Museum in Indianapolis, Indiana. My travel culminated at the Santa Fe Indian Market in New Mexico. The Santa Fe Indian Market was a pivotal point in my project because of the sheer number of artists who participate. Because of the enormous size of this market–over one thousand Native artists from more than one hundred tribal communities in North America and Canada participate–as well as the multitude of smaller markets that occur during the same weekend, I was able to see an incredible variety of artwork during a short amount of time. Driving to and from New Mexico from New York State gave me the opportunity to stop at many different art venues including museums, galleries, and individual artist studios. At that point in time, I was interested in the connections between artists and art-making traditions, particularly how we create and hold community across a great expanse of geographical distance. Through talking with artists and engaging with their work, I explored the commonalities of art language, coupled with Indigenous sensibilities and art-making traditions, that are passed down generationally through families of artists.
I came away from my trip with an incredible wealth of connections with artists that met my research criteria in ways I hadn’t anticipated. By September, Yasamin and I were excited to begin a tangible expression of the new pathways found in the research through the exhibition. However, we were forced to move from the initially-planned venue in Concord, NH, which also meant a loss of the financial resources tied to that location. Luckily, Yasamin was able to leverage a move to Positive Street Art’s Gallery in Nashua, New Hampshire and their satellite gallery at the Manchester Chamber of Commerce. This change required us to re-evaluate the project, but it also re-invigorated our original vision for the exhibition.

The exhibition,Echoes and Shifts, shows the work of ten Haudenosaunee artists, with substantial Akwesasronon representation. (The Haudenosaunee Confederacy is made up of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca and Tuscarora Nations and stretches mostly across what is now called New York State.) The artist representation centered the project in a significant way, as the show became directly connected with my homelands of Akwesasne but also included several artists from our Haudenosaunee relatives. This fit beautifully with the idea that had sparked my Fellowship research and we ended up with a web of kinship through direct familial connections, Tribal Nation relationships, and knowledge sharing through art practice and found community within the Granite State.

Echoes and Shiftsis broad in its goals, ambitions, and underlying themes but remains focused on community. We seek to offer the youth and local residents more language and nuance with which to speak about the complexity and diversity within Indian Country; to provide insight into the breadth of artistic conversations happening in contemporary Native art; and to showcase the wealth of talent and artistry coming from Akwesasne. We aim to challenge stereotypes and dominant discourses around Indigenous art and creative practices in New England, and provide a platform for these creators to share their stories and perspectives that celebrate the diversity of Native artistic expression.

Zoe Dobuler:I would love to begin with a bit of context about your involvement with Counterpublic – you were part of a team of curators, each of whom engaged different spaces and the land along Jefferson Avenue, a six-mile continuous stretch that moves through many of St. Louis’s demographics. Your contributions were focused primarily on the area between what is colloquially known as the State Streets Neighborhood and Sugarloaf Mound, the last remaining mound built by Native communities left in the city. I would love to hear how you came to that site – what drew you to it initially, and how did it fit into your broader practice and the wider aims of the exhibition?
Risa Puleo:Counterpublic’s invitation to respond to St. Louis allowed for a serendipitous meeting of many worlds that I was investigating independently of each other. When Counterpublic director James McAnnaly first got in touch, I had been visiting different mound sites throughout the Midwest and Southeast. I was newly teaching Native American art history at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago and imagining what a class about medieval North America could be. There is no medieval art history of the Americas at any college or university that I know of, I think because the discipline is built on European methods that have historically reinforced theterra nullius(meaning blank slate) logic of settler colonialism. Visiting mound sites throughout the Midwest and the South was also a reason to get outside the house and go to places where there weren’t a lot of people during quarantine.
The research into Mississippian Mound Building culture came after two really big shows, probably the shows, at least until Counterpublic, that I’m best known for.Monarchs: Brown and Native Artists in the Path of the Butterfly(2017) aimed to draw out the structural logic that connected NoDAPL protests at Standing Rock and threats to build a border wall. Monarchs brought together brown and Native artists from across the Americas living in the US in a moment when the changeability of settler borders revealed them to be methods to enclose, capture, contain, and manage the lives of people who are Indigenous to the Americas. InWalls Turned Sideways: Artists Confront the Justice System(2018), I was thinking about the relationship between the institutions of the museum and the prison, seeing the former as a disciplinary agent, and the latter as a collection of people to show. I applied an abolitionist framework, focusing on artists who leveraged their practices to find strategic pressure points in the system to enact an intervention. I was writing the catalogs forMonarchsandWallsat the same time and also didn't have enough distance to see how they were related.
The way that my curatorial practice works is that one show will have a question and the next show is created as a kind of answer that also generates a new question. I then look for artists who are asking similar questions. The geographic specificity of St. Louis and the mounds were the missing pieces to the unanswered question that connectedMonarchsandWalls. Counterpublic offered an opportunity to propose an answer: the prison cannot be abolished until the settled nation that it acts as an extension of is also dismantled.ZD:I’m curious what you mean by “the geographic specificity of St. Louis” – beyond the geography of the city itself, how did its place within the larger U.S. impact your thinking about the project?RP:Something I came to understand about St. Louis over the three years that I was working there was how the city developed its identity as the “Gateway to the West:” It was the place from which the majority of U.S. soldiers who were sent West to dispossess and enact mass genocide of Native populations, to open the path for the settlers who followed them, were deployed. In other words, the “Gateway to the West,” from another perspective, is the gateway to dispossession.
The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 made St. Louis the frontier of the U.S. But after the U.S. gained jurisdiction of lands that had been Spanish, then Mexican claims, St. Louis became the center of the country and the frontier was pushed further and further west. This shift from the edge to the center of the country made it a launching point for soldiers, settlers, and also ideology: St. Louis is the birthplace of the idea of Manifest Destiny, developed as a propaganda device by Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton.
There is a park named for this Senator at the edge of the State Streets neighborhood. The park is bounded by a street called Arsenal. So named because it led to the U.S. military’s arsenal of weapons and ammunition used throughout the West. In thinking about the sheer numbers of soldiers and settlers that passed through this site and about the white supremacists who used the Park to stage a campaign of terror later, I began to understand, in this place, that the visual experience of St. Louis would have been one of brute force and violence. I began to think about sound and ephemeral media as a mechanism for finding solidarities outside of the visual that could decenter or offer a different experience. For example, I invited Raven Chacon to work in this space because of the ways his performance and sound installations provide new models for assembling in space.
The city also has a complicated identity and history as the edge of the South, let's call it, because of Missouri’s contentious relationship with slavery. St. Louis was a passageway into places north, like Chicago, where I live, and a space for fugitive people escaping the confines of slavery to move through or relocate to. This history is why St. Louis has such an incredible history of Black contributions to not only national but world culture. Jazz, Josephine Baker, and all the incredible people from St. Louis are entangled in this longer history of the city as the edge of the South. The way that prison abolition is practiced and theorized today since the publication ofThe New Jim Crow, especially in art exhibitions, is deeply tied to the South and the abolition of slavery in the U.S. But how do we construct an abolition that also includes the West?
St. Louis, as the gateway to the dispossession of the West on the edge of the South, was the perfect ground for thinking about the concurrent histories of slavery and dispossession and to pull together these lingering questions fromMonarchsandWallsabout how to marry abolitionist and decolonial methods. Working within these historical frameworks and theoretical parameters, the questions that I had for Counterpublic, then, were: How do I make a public art exhibition that does not restage an occupation? What material forms could show what has been erased from the city, reveal how carcerality or coloniality are inscribed into the city itself, or conversely, show us a future beyond that organizing structure? How could those forms also evade surveillance and live outside the possibility of being policed, captured, and contained, even as an image? I landed on sound, but also plants, dirt, clay; all elements that were already a part of the fabric of a place but that are often taken for granted, realizing how ecology and the literal land are entangled in the same systems.
ZD:It's so interesting to think about this kind of project in the context of what is technically a triennial, which brings to mind the tradition of triennials and biennials, connections to spectacle and imbrication with the market, capitalism. The ways you’re describing your intervention, and Counterpublic as a whole, seem to be working against much of this, especially in how visibility and visibility politics are employed. Engaging in visibility politics, but avoiding creating a spectacle, feels like a delicate balance.
RP:The worst experiences that I've had at perennial exhibitions feel akin to art treasure hunts with exhibition guides functioning like a map. Visitors are rewarded with an artistic experience that engages with a city’s history, often creating a spectacle for a city’s most traumatic places. I’ve had experiences of navigating other people’s hometowns through artworks made by outsiders who showed me a very painful history in ways that I thought were unethical or at the very least, callous. And I was also thinking—everybody in Counterpublic was thinking—about how St. Louis’s community was Counterpublic’s primary audience. What is our ethical responsibility to them, their communities, homes, and histories?
ZD:Yes, exactly. Based on that, I'm curious how you came to the projects that you ended up executing and why you felt that those were sort of an answer, or an offering, to the questions that were framing your thinking?
RP:I thought deeply about what it meant to make any sort of gesture in a place that I have no claim to—and that has no claim to me—as a guest in that space. I really wanted to tread lightly and invite artists with a similar ethic. So the first thing that James [McAnnally] and I did was write to the Osage Nation and ask them for formal permission to make Sugarloaf Mound—the last remaining mound in St. Louis, a place once called Mound City—one of the terminal sites of the exhibition and to begin a relationship. Early in the process, I also made a declaration that Sugarloaf Mound, a site of Osage cultural and spiritual significance, should not be considered as a potential site for artistic engagement. I felt any intervention into that space could only function as a trespass. Literally, because to cross the fence that surrounds Sugarloaf is to trespass on Osage Nation, who purchased it as property reclaiming this important ancestral site as an extension of the Nation from their displaced territories in Oklahoma. And conceptually, because to think about the layer of artistic intervention atop this site also seemed to negate the Mound itself and the very long history it has both experienced and witnessed.
Instead, I invited Osage artist Anita Fields and her extended artistic family to work in the field adjacent to Sugarloaf Mound. Anita created an incredible installation calledWayBackthat speaks to displacement and the homecoming that Sugarloaf Mound represents. Anita’s youngest son Nokosee composed the sound component for the installation and her eldest son Yatika helped organize the closing events: a production of Wahzhazhe Puppet Theatre’s “Sky E.Ko Tells Stories of Way Back,” about Osage history from creation to today, written, directed, and produced by Anita’s daughter, Walena Quenton, in collaboration with Candice Byrd-Boney and Russell Tallchief.
This is another angle to how I came to the idea of making a public art show that did not restage an occupation and could evade surveillance: How do we not replicate the systems that we’re imbricated in?
On one hand, these present but overlooked forms like sound and plants led me to artists Raven Chacon and jackie sumell.
The mound-building culture that produced Cahokia, the largest mound in North America, and other mounds along the Mississippi River Basin, were connected by rivers. So I also began thinking more expansively about artists who had an ancestral relationship to St. Louis through these rivers. Anita and the Fields family are ancestrally from St. Louis and the greater Missouri area. Cannupa Hanska Luger is from North Dakota, which is linked to St. Louis through the Missouri River. I worked with Cannupa inMonarchsand appreciate the expansive position from which his works engage Indigenous futurity through ancestral and contemporary technology. X is Coushatta, a mound-building culture from Louisiana (and Chamorro) and has been making contemporary mounds throughout the Midwest. Jaune Quick-to-See Smith made a new map painting in response to St. Louis. In our conversations, she spoke about how the Missouri River connects St. Louis to Montana, where she is from. And it is by following this river that French settlers made it to Montana, enabling the French fur trade. We installed Jaune’s painting and also a canoe made of the wood of the Osage Orange tree and filled with artist-made replicas of the kind of objects that the French would have traded with Native people at MONACO gallery, which is located in the middle of the State Street neighborhood.
ZD:That brings us to the larger 'State Streets' project as well, which was also deeply inspired by both this specific place in St. Louis and by Jaune’s work.
RP:I have so much gratitude to ICI for supporting the research and production of a project that is very much still in process. And to Jaune, whose paintings have taught me so much and have inspired my thinking, not only for this exhibition but also for how I understand the United States, as a geography and as an entity.
On my first site visit to St. Louis, the State Streets neighborhood reminded me of the map paintings Jaune has been making for the past 50 years because of how the logic of the U.S. map is overlaid onto real space there. In that neighborhood, all the East-West streets are named for Native tribes and all the North-South streets are named for U.S. states. There are a lot of cities that name their streets this way. But in the context of St. Louis’s instrumental role in dispossession, the intersection of Osage St. and Missouri Ave. in the State Streets neighborhood indexes the history by which Osage Nation was forcibly removed from its ancestral homelands in the process of establishing Missouri’s statehood on the very ground where that removal happened.
There are a dozen or so intersections in this neighborhood with similar references: Wisconsin and Chippewa, Ohio and Miami, Minnesota and Dakota, Tennessee and Cherokee… In talking to St. Louisans and the neighborhood's residents, I learned that history is now abstract and removed from the community consciousness. Where residents saw the intersection of Tennessee St. and Cherokee Ave., I saw a reference to the Trail of Tears. The route through Missouri is just over 100 miles south of St. Louis. I responded to this space in two ways: First, I invited Jaune to the exhibition and was heartened to hear that St. Louis was a place she thought about often as it was the departure point for the French traders who made their way to her part of the world in the 18th century. Next, thinking about how public space was Counterpublic’s exhibition space, I also proposed to ICI that I “relabel” the State Streets neighborhood with information that could draw out the histories embedded in a street naming device.
What I learned from Jaune’s work in this context is how rivers are another form of placemaking and wayfinding, a means of inhabiting space and a method for navigating it that is an alternative to the imposition of colonial borders that the map of the US depends on. To further support Jaune’s work in this place, Counterpublic’s Director of Exhibitions, Jessi Mueller, and I decided to echo some existing signage in the city: In this neighborhood, you’ll see these bright yellow signs to make public service announcements, encouraging residents to buy local or not smoke weed near a school, for example. We adopted that style of sign, calling them “Erased History Markers.” So, for example, at the intersection of Missouri Ave. and Osage St., we created a sign that presented information about the series of 40-plus treaties in the 19th century that over time moved the Osage from Missouri to Kansas, and then to Oklahoma, where the Nation is now based.
Tracing a history of displacement on the static marker of the sign in the place from where people were originally displaced is an important aspect of the project, but so is etymology. Jaune’s paintings are also about naming systems and the language of place. So many states are named for Native people or appropriate Native place names. The signs were also opportunities to present alternative systems for naming and navigating space, extending Jaune’s painting into the neighborhood. And it's wonderful that the St. Louis Art Museum purchased Jaune’s painting and canoe for their collection so that they can continue to be in dialogue with the city.
ZD:That leads me to ask about some of the bureaucratic challenges that the project faced or the bureaucratic processes that it instigated, the conversations it prompted among you, the city, Native groups, and the artists. What is the status now?
RP:Some temporary signs were floated up for the opening, but we are still on hold with the City of St. Louis, which is undergoing a process of vetting the signs through their systems. This vetting includes reaching out to the 11 Nations referenced in the signs—meaning that there are 11 moments in the State Street neighborhood where a street named for a group of Native people intersects with a street named for the U.S. state that was created in the wake of the removal of those Native people from their ancestral homelands. (We consulted with Osage Nation before submitting the signs to the City of St. Louis). The city is not trying to censor the information; they want to make sure that the history written is reflective of the individual Nations’ version of that history.
At some point in what has become a very long process, I began to think that it's good that they've been hung up at the bureaucratic level of the city for so long. In proposing these signs to the city, we began a conversation about how streets are named in this neighborhood, which then unfolds a longer history of St. Louis’s role in dispossession. I think that having the opportunity to present a set of information to the city then became as interesting as putting them in the streets.
ZD:That’s an intervention in itself, absolutely.
RP:One thing that makes Counterpublic different from other perennial exhibitions is that it doesn’t get mired in the metaphor that “art creates change” through a passive viewing experience. Instead, the showmakers emphasize how the conditions by which art is incorporated into a place open the possibility of leveraging opportunities to create change. There are multiple moments in the show where each curator engages in a process to make a concrete change in the city. New Red Order has been working with property owners to repatriate the remaining portions of Sugarloaf Mound to Osage Nation. Curator Diya Vij worked with artist Jordan Weber to create a rainwater garden and park in a neighborhood that had no designated outdoor gathering space. We all saw the exhibition as an opportunity to have a conversation with the public.
Getting back to the decision to work with material and immaterial forms that evade capture, I think the process the signs initiated is a request for an ideological shift. These street signs function similarly to how monuments function, to inscribe an ideology literally in the streets themselves. Through this vetting process, we are indirectly asking the leaders of the city to grapple with the city’s history. When the signs make it to the streets—and Counterpublic is lobbying that they become permanent inclusions in the neighborhood—the public and the neighborhood’s residents get to be a part of this conversation. What is their response? In the process of interacting with the history of why their streets are named, maybe the neighborhood will choose something different.
ZD:Absolutely. And it’s striking the way that this displacement is also sort of doubly indexed in all of these individual slices of property that now exist there with these names as their addresses—the contrast of understanding the displacement and then going in and using your key to unlock your home that you get to own. It’s pretty remarkable.
And I'm curious: Did the city have these relationships with the Native communities beforehand? How robust was their communication with these groups in advance of your intervention?
RP:While I can’t speak for the city of St. Louis or the State of Missouri today, I do know that in fashioning its identity as the gateway to the dispossession of the West at the edge of the South, the state of Missouri made it illegal for Native people to be in the state until the 1920s.
I also know that at the same time that Counterpublic was being organized for its April 2023 opening, a group of people from St. Louis’s creative and academic institutions, working under the nameIndigenous St. Louis Working Group (formerly The STLr City Working Group), have begun an incredible process of reconnecting with all the displaced tribes of Missouri that were relocated to Oklahoma. The group formed in response to a call from St. Louis University to think about the city and state’s history of segregation. InThe Broken Heart of America, Walter Johnson argues that the eviction of Black communities from St. Louis City to the outlying St. Louis County, where Ferguson lies, operates by the same mechanism that dispossessed Osage, Fox, Sauk, and other Native peoples ancestrally belonging to Missouri and beyond, to reservations in Oklahoma. That Native removal is a template for segregation, and in this case, Native people have been segregated to another state. Missouri has no reservations, while Oklahoma, which shares a border with Missouri, is home to 39 tribes, the majority of whom were removed from the Eastern half of the United States after the Indian Removal Act of 1830, and from Missouri itself. TheIndigenous St. Louis Working Groupis doing very important work to begin to build relationships.
ZD:I remember in a previous conversation we had, you were talking about the different theories of cultural change—the radical, pull-the-rug-out-from-under-everyone model versus the slow burn. And that there’s a time and a place for one or both of those to come into play. Obviously, we often wish change would come in the form of pulling the rug out, but I think in some cases the slowness is necessary, the building of trust, of communication. And I think it's so rare that an art intervention can actually state that intent, and then do it.
RP:I appreciate your memory! The idea that art creates change through a viewing experience is rooted in an avant-gardist idea of acculturation: that a viewing experience causes an internal shift in an individual and over time a cultural shift in society; artists lead the way. This kind of change is very much a slow burn, especially in contrast with the popular imagination around a Marxist revolution. Then there is something in between revolutionary overhaul and small internal shifts: Direct action like the strikes of worker’s movements, sit-ins of Civil Rights campaigns, ACT UP’s spectacular civil disobedience campaigns, rely on a critical mass of people focusing their collective power towards a specific goal. I’m particularly indebted to the last two examples which guide my methods of withdrawal, negativity, and refusal throughout my work.
But, the model of change that I and others employed at Counterpublic is something different than all of the above. Lauri Jo Reynold’s definition of legislative art, which intervenes in larger government systems through processes of lobbying stakeholders and campaigning to decision-makers. The triennial format, but also the class structure of the art world in general, gave us an opportunity to be proximate to those groups as culture brokers. I’m also thinking of the phrase “a wrench in the system” which describes interference in working order. But a wrench is also a tool that can be used to tweak a system as well as to disrupt it. It’s the intention that one brings and the force that one applies that makes the difference between tweaking and disrupting, which itself is the difference between reform and abolition. I’m not a reformist, but I like the idea of working both angles at once, small actions, reforms, that accumulate into a systemic shift resulting in the abolition of the original system. Building as we dismantle.
It’s interesting to think about the time of change as it intersects with the time of an exhibition. I think of the exhibition itself as a window into a process; it is the time that the public gets to see the result of the artistic, curatorial, and administrative labor that has taken place up until that point of the opening. The exhibition morphs throughout its run as artists, agents, and viewers intersect and interact. But, the work begins before the exhibition opens and continues after it closes. ​

About Jordan Wilson
Jordan Wilson is currently a PhD student in Anthropology at New York University. He is a member of the Musqueam First Nation, in what is now Vancouver, British Columbia, and holds an MA in Anthropology and a BA in Indigenous Studies, both obtained at the University of British Columbia. Prior to this, Wilson was a Curatorial Intern at the Belkin Art Gallery (2017-2018), where he contributed to the exhibitionBeginning with the Seventies: Collective Acts(2018). Wilson’s current research examines the politics of Indigenous language revitalization, the legacies of anthropological collecting, the practices of collecting institutions, as well as questions concerning Indigenous sovereignty and settler colonialism. His curatorial practice often involves considering the forms of relationships contemporary Indigenous peoples maintain with their ancestral art, material culture, and immaterial heritage currently held by colonial institutions, and the potential of Indigenous art in the public realm. This work is informed by desires for structural change in institutions with regard to Indigenous representation and engagement, as well as a commitment to the well-being of his home community. Wilson was a co-curator ofc̓əsnaʔəm, the city before the city(2015), an exhibition developed collaboratively with Musqueam; and the long-term exhibitionIn a Different Light: Reflecting on Northwest Coast Art(2017) at the University of British Columbia Museum of Anthropology. His writing has appeared inInuit Art Quarterly,The Capilano Review, Biography: An Interdisciplinary Quarterly, andMuseum Worlds. He is also a writer and co-editor of the forthcoming bookWhere the Power Is: Indigenous Perspectives on Northwest Coast Art(Fall 2021).

Alvendia lives and works in Chicago, where he founded several alternative art spaces, including most recently, Silver Galleon Press (2008-present). He regularly collaborates with artist-run initiatives around North America to develop site-specific community-driven exhibitions, events, and publications that create space for experimentation, discussion, and collaboration. Through his ICI Fellowship in 2021, Alvendia conducted research trips to cities in the Midwest to explore and learn from the culture of experimental, artist-run, or alternative spaces in the region, as well as radical creative collaboratives and other independent DIY initiatives along the Mississippi River and its tributaries, mapping an archipelago of art worlds in the middle of the United States.
This Fellowship is made possible by a grant from the Elizabeth Firestone Graham Foundation, with the additional support of ICI's Board of Trustees.
Brandon Alvendia, an artist, curator, and educator, actively promotes artist-run initiatives across North America, fostering community-driven exhibitions, events, and publications.
