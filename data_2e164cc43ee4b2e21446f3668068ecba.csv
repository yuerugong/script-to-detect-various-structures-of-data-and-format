This Exhibition is now closed.
We are thrilled to present the captivating works of Maxwell G. Miller, an American contemporary realist artist whose compositions transport viewers into a world of dramatic portraiture and intricate still life, rich with narrative depth. Maxwell's journey as an artist has been influenced by his background in scenic artistry, and expertise in theatrical puppetry. This unique blend of experiences has infused his paintings and charcoal drawings with a sense of theatricality that captivates the imagination and sparks a profound engagement with storytelling.
In an era witnessing a resurgence of realism, Maxwell stands at the forefront, skilfully weaving narratives through recognizable imagery.
We invite you to immerse yourself in Maxwell's world of artistic narratives and experience the fusion of history, mythology, and contemporary realism.

AboutEuphoria
Euphoria brings together a group of contemporary artists to explore the theme of happiness and the complex blend of emotions that exist alongside it. The artists in the show present artworks which reflect personal responses to the theme and explore how euphoria can be found and experienced in a variety of ways including in the joy of movement, the love of the natural world, the brilliance of colour and the creative process itself. The artists present a striking selection of artworks which have been created using a wide variety of techniques.
The range of responses also reflects the complexity of the theme and how euphoria can be intrinsically linked with sadness and the rest of the emotional spectrum. They show us how euphoria can be such an intense sensation that it may easily swing over into a crazed, manic or over-excited state. Euphoria showcases artworks which reflect the inner voices of the artists, who like so many of us, have experienced the emotional challenges of the global pandemic.
This has given each artist time to reflect and consider exactly what is happiness.
What does happiness look like? And what does it mean to them?
In the show, Cristian Diez-Sanchez presents a series of sculptures which explore the emotional relationship between the human form and its environment. Elisa Velasquez creates sublime, abstracted landscapes with fields of bright, vibrant colours, textures and brushstrokes. In her work, artist Julie Waas, expands joyful organic and geometric forms with interweaving lines, dots, stripes, circles, triangles, leaves, zig-zag’s and undulating lines. Manuel Salazar’s paintings of energetic, swirling forms generate multiple perceptions. Mónica Acedo explores a love of the natural world and nostalgia in her paintings.

AboutCOLLECTIVE DREAMS
Collective Dreams, the present online exhibition at Smart Artist Hub, cultivates a process to unravel a few common metaphorical junctions among five selected artists working with diverse styles and intentions.The exhibition maps personal, timely and especially nuanced styles as well as methods of visual expression by the artists.The genre of artworks varies from surreal to abstract but narrates identical angst or fervour of illustrating (not literally but essentially) their dreams, whether real or rhetorical.Have these dreams become mobilised by what Carl Jung explains the term ‘archetypes’? Or is there an attempt in signifying the latent as mentioned by Sigmund Freud?The common aspects of signifiers or signs like colour, text, and form, whether in a surreal or abstract manner, function in an archetypal manner thereby denoting the common ground of socio-political-cultural sentiments.Anatolli Kazymyrchuk’s paintings, contextualised images in Jak Jak and Kevin Lawlers representations, surreal scapes by Ruben Cukier, and abstracts by Silvana Abram assimilate to curate a package of political oneness.Why political?The empowered oneness by the charged tools ideologically authorises the conduct of personal dreams, historical (in the case of Lawler) , cultural (like Cukier) and present ( probably Abrams abstract). This collective psyche constitutes a collective range of illusions, delusions and latent psychological movement.Collective Dreams not only attempt at representing the latent suppressed desires but also rebuilds the newer idea of consciousness that more than being utopian stems from the chord of quasi-realistic sensibilities.

SILVANA ABRAM                                     JOURNEY INTO THE SUBLIME,https://www.smartartisthub.com/exhibitions/silvana-abram-journey-into-the-sublime,"Virtual Solo ExhibitionFriday 4th March - Sunday, 3rd April 2022
Journey to the Sublime celebrates the process and many experiential germinations during the course of introspecting, analysing and creating.  While the face of each germination may be different, the underpinning intention armed with motivation and persistence is common. The exhibition maps two kinds of Silvana Abram’s journey: the passage towards the creative essence and the process of beginning from the blank canvas. Here, we trace physical or matter and the abstract or sublime derivatives, which denote not only the conceptual realm but also an identity to her daily meditative realisations.
“Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.”
― Khalil Gibran, The Prophet

Silvana Abram’s practice is spontaneous yet pragmatic. They are trials and products at the same time.
The binary does not confine to the given time or material, rather it dissolves within the flow, imbuing a transitory effect. The abstract motifs in watercolours and charcoal are neither static nor in the movement, they are themselves in their formal qualities.
So, is it our conditioned perception that identifies us with some confined space?Or are we staring at the efforts of the journey to sublime?
Silvana's expertise in watercolours again discloses her method of timely control. While letting the hues flow over the canvas, she takes a complete charge in merging the next hue. What germinates may appear spontaneous but it is calculated and pragmatic! The interplay of contrast in Silvana’s rendition is motivating, and authoritative.
“Every time – in front a white canvas, I embark on a journey and cross layers of matter until I reach the creative essence. Following from the depth of your breath you compose forms and sounds – cast in the harmony of the universe.”
― Silvana Abram
Journey to the Sublime is an effort to momentarily realise our sensorial alteration in its truest form!

Often time is divided into planes that operate simultaneously while you either remain oblivious or rarely aware of them. And the subconscious continues to react to the movements on these planes.Today/Tomorrow, the virtual group exhibition of six artists, namely Daniel Meakin, William Brown, Nicholas Sims, Zifeng Zang, Nuria Gonzalez Alcaide, and Glenn Badham, reverberates with those movements which are in between the immediate past as well as present—Today and Tomorrow.
Today/ Tomorrowweaves a story in time through the visual language that operates in surrealism and abstract expressionism to develop an altogether new set of parameters of dialogue and partake.  From being made, remade, subverted, repressed, re-emerged and merging with the ephemeral of the material, this language dwindles between what happened, is happening, and is about to happen. And during this course, the curated set provides a newer depth in the conscience of the self, honing the subtle capacities within.
WhileDaniel Meakin,Nicholas SimsandGlenn Badhampose the real into surreal and vice versa, the dissolution of the real in the abstract byNuria Gonzalez Alcaide,William BrownandZifeng Zangstitch a distinct and wholesome narrative.
But is the abstract totally devoid of reality? Or is it a heightened awareness of being in the becoming of reality as essence?Or are these planes of colour, oblivious and aware at the same time, letting us enter into new realms of identity?
“On the mountains of truth you can never climb in vain: either you will reach a point higher up today, or you will be training your powers so that you will be able to climb higher tomorrow.”
- Friedrich Nietzsche

This exhibition collects works of 13 artists whose paintings and sculpture interpret the theme of ‘Resilience’. These works exude a humming joy and reflect the ebbs and flows of adaptation in the face of adversity.
In this exhibition, resilience takes many forms, from lasting residues and lingering spectres of shadowy memory that inhabit the intimate, psychic terrain to ecstatic, buzzing vibrances of light and form, that display the intricate web of social experience and embrace difference through colourful juxtaposition.
The idea of ‘Resilience’ indicates a certain kind of strength, but these artists capture a softness and care that connects the human and non-human world, exploring the tender warmth of life that enables people to rebuild and continue on.
