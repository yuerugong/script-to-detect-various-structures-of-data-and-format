About,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/about/,"



We provide tools and platforms for professional development and facilitate an open peer-to-peer network inviting participants to be part of a generative ecology of skills and knowledge sharing. Across all of our work, both critically and practically, we are committed to challenging the barriers to equality and inclusivity within our industry.
Through all aspects of our programme we engage with the concept of diaspora as a critical framework through which we can address and complicate notions of identity, test and explore new innovative curatorial models, and create space for artistic and discursive interventions into historical narratives and systems of representation.
Based in London, ICF has conceived and produced projects with artists, curators and thinkers who engage with diaspora across the UK, Europe, the Caribbean, Asia, the Middle East and Australia.

Larry Achiampong,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/larry-achiampong/,"Larry Achiampong's solo and collaborative projects employ film, still imagery, aural and visual archives, live performance, objects and sound to explore ideas surrounding class, gender, cross-cultural and digital identity. With works that examine his communal and personal heritage – in particular, the intersection between Popular culture and the residues of colonisation, Achiampong crate-digs the vaults of history. These investigations examine constructions of ‘the self’ through the activity of splicing the audible and visual materials of personal and interpersonal archives, offering multiple perspectives that reveal the deeply entrenched inequalities in contemporary society.
Achiampong recently shot his first feature and most ambitious film to date – Wayfinder, which was distributed by Verve Pictures for cinematic release across the UK in July 2022 and is available on DVD and streaming platforms . Set during a pandemic, the film tracks the movements of its central protagonist – The Wanderer, a young girl (played by Perside Rodrigues), on an intrepid journey across England. Travelling from North to South, The Wanderer passes through different regions, towns and landscapes, encountering people, stories and situations on her way. Presented across six chapters, including ‘The North’, ‘The Land of Smoke’ and ‘The Kingdom of the East’, this epic film builds a dialogue around the themes of class and economic exclusion, belonging and displacement, cultural heritage and the meaning of home.
Recent projects include commissions with The Line, London; The Liverpool Biennial 2021 and Art on the Underground, Roundel designs and a permanent sculptural intervention for Transport for London’s Westminster Underground Station, London (2019 and 2022). Recent solo exhibitions include Wayfinder, Turner Contemporary/MK Gallery/BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Margate, Milton Keynes, Gateshead (2022-2023); Relic Traveller: Where You and I Come From, We Know That We Are Not Here Forever, Phi Foundation for Contemporary Art, Montreal (2021); Beyond the Substrata, curated by Norman Rosenthal, Copperfield Gallery at Frieze Focus, 12 Piccadilly Arcade, London (2020); When the Sky Falls, John Hansard Gallery, Southampton (2020); Pan African Flag For The Relic Travellers Alliance & Relic Traveller, Phase 1, 019, Ghent (2019); Dividednation, Primary, Nottingham (2019).
Achiampong (b. 1984, UK, British Ghanaian) is a Jarman Award nominated artist (2021). He completed a BA in Mixed Media Fine Art at University of Westminster in 2005 and an MA in Sculpture at The Slade School of Fine Art in 2008. In 2020 Achiampong was awarded the Stanley Picker fellowship and in 2019 received the Paul Hamlyn Artist award in recognition for his practice. He lives and works in London and Essex, and was a tutor on the Photography MA programme at Royal College of Art between 2016 – 2021. Achiampong currently serves on the Board of Trustees at Iniva (Institute of International Visual Arts) facilitating art policies in the UK and internationally and also holds a place on the board of trustees for Elephant Trust and is represented by Copperfield, London.

John Akomfrah,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/john-akomfrah/,"John Akomfrah is a hugely respected artist and filmmaker, whose works are characterised by their investigations into memory, post-colonialism, temporality and aesthetics and often explores the experiences of migrant diasporas globally. Akomfrah was a founding member of the influential Black Audio Film Collective, which started in London in 1982 alongside the artists David Lawson and Lina Gopaul, who he still collaborates with today. Their first film, Handsworth Songs (1986) explored the events surrounding the 1985 riots in Birmingham and London through a charged combination of archive footage, still photos and newsreel. The film won several international prizes and established a multi-layered visual style that has become a recognisable motif of Akomfrah’s practice. Other works include the three-screen installation The Unfinished Conversation (2012), a moving portrait of the cultural theorist Stuart Hall’s life and work; Peripeteia (2012), an imagined drama visualising the lives of individuals included in two 16th century portraits by Albrecht Dürer and Mnemosyne (2010) which exposes the experience of migrants in the UK, questioning the notion of Britain as a promised land by revealing the realities of economic hardship and casual racism.
In 2015, Akomfrah premiered his three-screen film installation Vertigo Sea (2015), which explores what Ralph Waldo Emerson calls ‘the sublime seas’. Fusing archival material, readings from classical sources and newly shot footage, Akomfrah’s piece focuses on the disorder and cruelty of the whaling industry and juxtaposes it with scenes of many generations of migrants making epic crossings of the ocean for a better life. In 2017, Akomfrah presented his largest film installation to date, Purple (2017), at the Barbican in London, co-commissioned by Bildmuseet Umeå, Sweden, TBA21—Academy, The Institute of Contemporary Art/ Boston, Museu Coleção Berardo, Lisbon and Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow. The six-channel video installation addresses climate change, human communities and the wilderness. More recently, Akomfrah debuted Precarity (2017) at Prospect 4 New Orleans, following the life of forgotten New Orleans jazz singer Charles ‘Buddy’ Bolden. In 2019, on the occasion of his participation at the first Ghana Pavilion at the 58th Venice Biennale, John Akomfrah presented Four Nocturnes (2019), a three-channel piece that reflects on the complex intertwined relationship between humanity’s destruction of the natural world and our destruction of ourselves.
Akomfrah (born 1957) lives and works in London. He has had numerous solo exhibitions including Midlands Art Centre, Birmingham, UK (2022); E-WERK, Freiburg, Germany (2022); Remai Modern, Saskatoon, Canada (2022); Towner Eastbourne, Eastbourne, UK (2021); Fundació Antoni Tàpies, Barcelona, Spain (2021); Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo, Sevilla, Spain (2020); Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA, USA (2020); Secession, Vienna, Austria (2020); BALTIC, Gateshead, UK (2019); ICA Boston, MA, USA (2019); Museu Coleção Berardo, Lisbon, Portugal (2018); New Museum, New York, NY, USA (2018); Bildmuseet, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden (2015, 2018); SFMOMA, San Francisco, CA, USA (2018); Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid, Spain (2018); Barbican, London, UK (2017); Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester, UK (2017); Turner Contemporary, Margate, UK (2016); Nikolaj Kunsthal, Copenhagen, Denmark (2016); STUK Kunstcentrum, Leuven, Belgium (2016);  Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum, Michigan, USA (2014); Tate Britain, London, UK (2013-14) and a week long series of screenings at MoMA, New York, USA (2011).

In 2018 Screen International tipped Akoto as a “Star of Tomorrow”. The most recent feature film he has produced QUEEN OF GLORY (from actor and first time director Nana Mensah) will have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2021. Having forged a path within visual arts with mentoring from John Akomfrah and the Oscar-winning Asif Kapadia, Baff’s work embraces the fluidity of visual grammar, notions of plurality, (self) perceptions and societal implications of human bodily movement (disability, ritual, dance). Most recently Baff’s work explores the artistic potential of VR/AR as he becomes increasingly concerned with how the digital revolution might avoid the same prejudices, exclusions and inequalities which arose from our industrial and colonial eras.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-07-26-at-14.37.21-768x543.png,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Barby Asante,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/barby-asante/,"Barby Asante is a London based artist, curator, educator and occasional DJ. Her work is concerned with the politics of place, space memory and the histories and legacies of colonialism. Asante’s work is collaborative, performative and dialogic, often working with groups of people as contributors, collaborators or co researchers.
Her artistic practice explores the archival, makes propositions, collects and maps stories and contributions of people of colour using storytelling, collective actions, and ritual, to excavate, unearth and interrogate given narratives, making works that consider migration, safe spaces to gather in cities antagonistic to ones presence and how one maps the self as a contributor to narratives of society, culture and politics. She resists the idea that the stories of “Other-ness” are alternatives to dominant given narratives, but for her these stories and narratives are interruptions, utterances, presences that exist within, that are invisible, unheard, missing or ignored. By making these narratives and stories visible, asking questions and making proposals she is interested in what these possibilities offer as we examine our present and envision our futures.
Asante’s projects include; The South London Black Archive (Peckham Platform / Tate Modern, 2012) an archive project, mapping black music and memories in South London, through an invitation to audiences and local people to create the archive of black music memory collaboratively. Baldwin’s Nigger RELOADED (Iniva, Nottingham Contemporary, Framer Framed/ Art Rotterdam 2014- onwards) with the London based collective sorryyoufeeluncomfortable, using Horace Ove’s 1968 film Baldwin’s Nigger as a start for a contemporary study of Baldwin’s provocation, through a reflective re-enactment ritual of transcribing, rewriting, re-staging and re-performing the original event.
Her current artistic research is focused on her long term project, As Always a Painful Declaration of Independence : For Ama. For Aba. For Charlotte and Adjoa. This is being realised in a series of project episodes, including Intimacy and Distance (Diaspora Pavilion, Venice, 2017) For Ama. For Aba. For Charlotte and Adjoa (Dolph Projects, London, 2017), The Queen and the Black Eyed Squint, (Starless Midnight, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Arts, Gateshead, 2017, Get up Stand Up Now, Somerset House, London 2019, GOMA, Glasgow, 2021) and Declaration of Independence (Diaspora Pavilion, Venice, Feminsist Emergency, Birkbeck, London, Sonic Soundings, Venice, 2017, Library of Performing Rights, LADA, London, Resisting Narratives, The Horse Hospital, London, 2018, BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Arts, Gateshead, 2019, Bergen Kuntsatll, 2020). The project explores the social, cultural and political agency of women of colour, as they navigate historic legacies of colonialism, independence, migration and the contemporary global socio-political climate, through performative actions that engage with historic spaces, archives and collections.

Kader Attia,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/kader-attia/,"Kader Attia (b. 1970, France), grew up in Paris and in Algeria. Preceding his studies at the École Supérieure des Arts Appliqués Duperré and the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris, and at Escola Massana, Centre d’Art i Disseny in Barcelona, he spent several years in Congo and in South America.
The experience with these different cultures, the histories of which over centuries have been characterised by rich trading traditions, colonialism and multi-ethnic societies, has fostered Kader Attia’s intercultural and interdisciplinary approach of research. For many years, he has been exploring the perspective that societies have on their history, especially as regards experiences of deprivation and suppression, violence and loss, and how this affects the evolving of nations and individuals — each of them being connected to collective memory.
His socio-cultural research has led Kader Attia to the notion of Repair, a concept he has been developing philosophically in his writings and symbolically in his oeuvre as a visual artist. With the principle of Repair being a constant in nature — thus also in humanity —, any system, social institution or cultural tradition can be considered as an infinite process of Repair, which is closely linked to loss and wounds, to recuperation and re-appropriation. Repair reaches far beyond the subject and connects the individual to gender, philosophy, science, and architecture, and also involves it in evolutionary processes in nature, culture, myth and history.
In 2016, Kader Attia founded La Colonie, a space in Paris to share ideas and to provide an agora for vivid discussion. Focussing on decolonialisation not only of peoples but also of knowledge, attitudes and practices, it aspires to de-compartmentalise knowledge by a trans-cultural, trans-disciplinary and trans-generational approach. Driven by the urgency of social and cultural reparations, it aims to reunite which has been shattered, or drift apart.
Kader Attia’s work has been shown in  group shows and biennials such as the 12th Shanghai Biennial; the 12th Gwangju Biennial; the 12th Manifesta, Palermo; the 57th Venice Biennial; dOCUMENTA(13) in Kassel; Met Breuer, New York; Kunsthalle Wien; MoMA, New York; Tate Modern, London; Centre Pompidou, Paris; or The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York — just to name a few. Notable solo exhibitions include ‘The Museum of Emotion’, The Hayward Gallery, London; ‘Scars Remind Us that Our Past is Real’, Fundacio Joan Miro, Barcelona; ‘Roots also grow in concrete’, MacVal in Vitry-sur-Seine; ‘The Field of Emotion’, The Power Plant, Toronto; Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; ‘Repairing the Invisible’, SMAK, Ghent; Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; ‘Sacrifice and Harmony’, Museum für Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt/Main; ‘The Injuries are Here’, Musée Cantonal des Beaux Arts de Lausanne; ‘Contre Nature’, Beirut Art Center; ‘Continuum of Repair: The Light of Jacob’s Ladder’, Whitechapel Gallery, London; and KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin.

One of David’s main concerns is the notion of diaspora and black representation in art. He co-curated the groundbreaking exhibitions Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance with Richard J. Powell at the Hayward Gallery in London in 1997, and Back to Black: Art, Cinema and the Racial Imaginary with Petrine Archer-Straw and Richard J. Powell at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 2005.
David has written extensively about photography and film. From 1996 to 2002, he was Co-Director of the African and Asian Visual Arts Archive (AAVAA) at the University of East London. From 2005 to 2011 he was a Curator at Platform for the Remember Saro-Wiwa Living Memorial.
Since 2006 David has been overseeing the growth and development of the ICF, and between 2009 and 2010, he was the Acting Director of the National Art Gallery of the Bahamas in Nassau.

Roger Ballen,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/roger-ballen/,"One of the most influential and important photographic artists of the 21st century, Roger Ballen’s photographs span over forty years.  His strange and extreme works confront the viewer and challenge them to come with him on a journey into their own minds as he explores the deeper recesses of his own.
Roger Ballen was born in New York in 1950 but for nearly 40 years he has lived and worked in South Africa. His work as a geologist took him out into the countryside and led him to take up his camera and explore the hidden world of small South African towns. At first he explored the empty streets in the glare of the midday sun but, once he had made the step of knocking on people’s doors, he discovered a world inside these houses which was to have a profound effect on his work. These interiors with their distinctive collections of objects and the occupants within these closed worlds took his unique vision on a path from social critique to the creation of metaphors for the inner mind. After 1994 he no longer looked to the countryside for his subject matter finding it closer to home in Johannesburg.
Over the past thirty five years his distinctive style of photography has evolved using a simple square format in stark and beautiful black and white. In the earlier works in the exhibition his connection to the tradition of documentary photography is clear but through the 1990s he developed a style he describes as ‘documentary fiction’. After 2000 the people he first discovered and documented living on the margins of South African society increasingly became a cast of actors working with Ballen in the series’ Outland (2000, revised in 2015) and Shadow Chamber (2005) collaborating to create powerful psychodramas.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/17bosindentity-2_0-768x432.jpeg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Sonia Boyce,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/sonia-boyce/,"Sonia Boyce OBE RA (b. London, 1962) is an interdisciplinary artist and academic working across film, photography, print, sound and installation.
In 2022 she presented FEELING HER WAY, a major new commission for the British Pavilion at the 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia for which she was awarded the Golden Lion for Best National Participation.
Boyce came to prominence in the early 1980s as a key figure in the burgeoning Black Arts Movement of that time with figurative pastel drawings and photo collages that addressed issues of race and gender in Britain. In 1987, she became one of the youngest artists of her generation to have her artwork acquired by Tate and the first Black-British female artist to enter the collection.
Since the 1990s Boyce’s practice has taken a significant multi-media and improvisational turn by bringing people together in a dynamic, social practice that encourages others to speak, sing or move in relation to the past and the present. Working across a range of media, Boyce’s practice is fundamentally collaborative and inclusive, fostering a participatory approach that questions artistic authorship and cultural difference. At the heart of her work are questions about the production and reception of unexpected gestures, with an underlying interest in the intersection of personal and political subjectivities.
For nearly forty years Boyce has consistently worked within the art school context. Since 2014 she has been a Professor at University of the Arts London, where she holds the inaugural Chair in Black Art & Design. A three year research project into Black Artists and Modernism culminated with the 2018 BBC Four documentary Whoever Heard of a Black Artist?, exploring the contribution of overlooked artists of African and Asian descent to the story of Modern British art. The artist’s 2018 retrospective at Manchester Art Gallery caused controversy when John William Waterhouse’s Hylas and the Nymphs (1896) was temporarily removed from public view. The withdrawal of the painting formed the basis of Boyce’s six-screen film and wallpaper installation Six Acts (2018).",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Crop-Over-768x509.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Ernest Breleur,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/ernest-breleur/,"Ernest Breleur was born in 1945 in Martinique. He lives and works in Martinique.
Breleur is today a  major figure in contemporary art in the Caribbean and internationally . He has taken part several times in numerous biennials such as those of Sao Paulo, the Seychelles, Santo Domingo, Ecuador, Cuba and Dakar. His works  are presented at major exhibitions such as recently  Caribbean: Crossroad of the world at the Queens Museum of Art in New York 2012-2013, or in 2011 with Escault, Rives Dérivés, international festival of contemporary sculpture .
Breleur’s work is large, rich and multiple. It is broken down into several periods. Many know him for his qualities as a painter, before, with the fwomagé group, and after, with the mythology of the moon series, the series of floating bodies, the white series to name but a few. Ernest Breleur’s work has always been prolific, serial; in search of openness and modernity. In 1992, the artist made a definitive break with painting. Since this pivotal date, Ernest Breleur has never ceased to found his singularity as an artist with a new material, radiography, and to apprehend in a very progressive way his approach to carving. He very broadly dealt with aesthetic and ethical questions which are for him fundamental in their relationship with the violence of globalization.
Since 2013, with the return to drawing, the artist who has always questioned death, has reversed the prism and today questions the living through the series Origin of the world and The enigma of desire. Returning to sculpture at the end of 2015 with the series The living, passage through the feminine, he will develop a series of sculptures nourished by this parenthesis of drawing.
Strengthened by all the encounters with, among others, Edouard Glissant, Patrick Chamoiseau , and even  Milan Kundera, his works appear among others in the collections of the FNAC, the FRAC Martinique, the Work Bank in Washington and the Clément Foundation.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Barbados-Martinique2-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

His photographs capture experiences of his community's arrival in Britain, the different landscapes and cultures he encountered, the different ways of survival and experiences of the wider African-Caribbean community.
In 2021 he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society.
Burke’s first notable exhibition, Handsworth from the Inside, was held at Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, and then the Commonwealth Institute in London in 1983. Since then his work has been exhibited at Light House, Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, The Black Arts Gallery in London, Cornerhouse in Manchester and Walsall Museum and Art Gallery, and he has held solo exhibitions abroad in New York City and Mali. In addition to traditional galleries and other such settings, Burke has purposely exhibited his work in locations more easily accessible to black audiences such as community centres, clubs, pubs, churches, pool halls and schools.[7] The 1993 exhibition From Negative Stereotype to Positive Image included his work alongside that of three other Birmingham photographers: Sir Benjamin Stone (1838-1914), Ernest Dyche (1887-1973) and Claudette Holmes (born 1962).[8] He was a significant contributor of imagery to the Birmingham photography magazine and collective, Ten.8.
Burke’s work has also been used in documentaries (including Handsworth Songs, 1986), television programmes, books and on record sleeves such as UB40’s “Jeffrey Morgan”. A biography A Retrospective, on the life and works of Burke, was published by Lawrence & Wishart, edited by Mark Sealy.[9] In 1990 Burke received a call from a friend in South Africa saying: “South Africa is going to be free and we need you here.” During two visits to the country, in 1990 then in 1996, Burke photographed the life of black South Africans just after Nelson Mandela’s release from prison and the subsequent ANC celebrations hosted and attended by Mandela for the anti-Apartheid veterans.
The “Vanley Burke Archive” maintained by Birmingham City Council is a constantly growing photographic and documentary community resource. Complementing his photographic documentation, Burke collects material which samples and evidences developments and activities of the black community in Britain. The material comprises things such as posters or flyers and funeral cards that may have been seen as disposable at the time of their creation but take greater significance when maintained in the context of his archive. They evidence and provide insight of the daily activities and everyday lives, cultural and religious beliefs, the arts, political ideals, health and other facets affecting the black community and others in Birmingham and in Britain. Burke is still documenting the black community in the UK and has more recently worked on a number of projects including an exhibition and publication project documenting the Asian community in Birmingham.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Vanley-Burke-768x616.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Hira Butt,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/hira-butt/,"Hira Butt is a British Pakistani artist based in Birmingham, England.
Born in 1987, Butt migrated to England from Lahore, Pakistan, after completing her Bachelor in Fine Arts in December 2009. Since then, Butt has worked on and off in different creative fields. In 2016, Butt got the opportunity to study Fine Arts and relished the chance; she stretched herself as an artist and completed her master in 2018 by winning the Master Degree Prize in Medium Practice, Birmingham City University.
Through her installations, Butt’s work explores ideologies of gender and cultural dominance, modern slavery, domestic violence, the place of South Asian women within marital and domestic spaces. Butt is also interested in the occidental impact on oriental cultures and their political, social, and psychological effects on the eastern diaspora. Finally, through personal experience and conversations with several South Asian women, Butt seeks to critique both the wedding day and the life promised that often does not materialise.
Butt often uses carefully selected mundane domestic objects, bejewel them and transform them to give them a new identity while maintaining their originality.

Sokari Douglas Camp,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/sokari-douglas-camp/,"Sokari Douglas Camp is a London-based artist who was born in Buguma, Rivers State, Nigeria. She is known internationally for her monumental sculptural works, which address the legacies of slavery, issues of power and gender, and the climate crisis.
Sokari studied fine art at Central School of Art and Design and the Royal College of Art. Sokari has represented Britain and Nigeria in National exhibitions and has had more than 40 solo shows worldwide, in venues such as National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institute 1988-89, the Museum of Mankind, London 1994/5. Her public artworks include Battle Bus: Living Memorial for Ken Saro‐Wiwa (2006), a full-scale replica of a Nigerian steel bus, which stands as a monument to the late Niger Delta activist and writer.
Sokari works intuitively and on her own, she draws ideas and works on the scale suggested by her drawings. Works vary in size from 30cm to 5 meters and more depending on the project. She is interested in movement, clothing, Kalabari culture, theatre and the environment.
Working with steel is very physical, and she used to joke that this was a way of keeping warm in the UK, but she enjoys the repetition of welding cutting and bending metal into shape. She works with sheet steel and has recently started working with recycled  oil barrels. These barrels are all over the world and familiar . Oil is a big feature in Sokari’s work because she comes from the Niger Delta where oil is the main produce. Her place of birth is unsafe to return to because of bad governance and pollution. Living in London and being gifted oil barrels by her local garage  introduced this material to her work. This made Sokari think of her environment and the products that are derived from oil/ petroleum . Every thing seems to have an element of this product, for example, on my desk, my keyboard, pen, sellotape, head phones, my jumper, and the concoction which has created my lipstick.
Sokari edits and selects what to bring forth in her sculpture. For example, ‘Manmade’   focuses on  a car and  oil barrels for a platform  (illustrating that asphalt is a petroleum derivative). These items for this installation sit in a wagon on a station in Japan. Trains are a fantastic form of transport and engineering, running on diesel or steam but needing oil to keep lubricated.This  recent sculpture embraces our past and our current state, and our attachment to oil.
In 2003 Sokari was shortlisted for the Trafalgar Square Fourth Plinth. Her work is in permanent collections at The Smithsonian Museum, Washington, D.C., Setagaya Museum, Tokyo and the British Museum, London. In 2005 she was awarded a CBE in recognition of her services to art.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sokari-Douglas-Camp-All-the-World-is-now-Richer-2012-Diaspora-Pavilion-2017-Venice.-Image-by-Francesco-Allegretto-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Enrique Chagoya,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/enrique-chagoya/,"Drawing from his experiences living on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border in the late 70’s, and also in Europe in the late 90’s, Enrique Chagoya juxtaposes secular, popular, and religious symbols in order to address the ongoing cultural clash between the United States, Latin America and the world as well. He uses familiar pop icons to create deceptively friendly points of entry for the discussion of complex issues. Through these seemingly harmless characters Chagoya examines the recurring subject of colonialism and oppression that continues to riddle contemporary American foreign policy.
Chagoya was born and raised in Mexico City. His father, a bank employee by day and artist by night, encouraged his interest in art by teaching Chagoya color theory and how to sketch at a very early age. As a young adult, Chagoya enrolled in the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, where he studied political economy and contributed political cartoons to union newsletters. He relocated to Veracruz and directed a team focused on rural-development projects, a time he describes as “an incredible growing experience…[that] made me form strong views on what was happening outside in the world.” This growing political awareness would later surface in Chagoya’s art. At age 26, Chagoya moved to Berkeley, California and began working as a free-lance illustrator and graphic designer. Disheartened by what he considered to be the narrow political scope of economics programs in local colleges, Chagoya turned his interests to art. He enrolled in the San Francisco Art Institute, where he earned a BFA in printmaking in 1984. He then pursued his MA and MFA at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1987. He moved to San Francisco in 1995. He has been exhibitng his work nationally and internationally for over two decades with a major retrospective organized by the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa in 2007 that traveled to UC Berkelye Art Museum and to the Palms Spring Art Museum in 2008 ( fully illustrated bilingual catalog was published). In the Fall of 2013, a major survey of his work opened at Centro Museum ARTIUM, in Vitoria-Gasteiz, capital city of the Basque Country, near Bilbao, Spain (with a trilingual catalog documenting the exhibition). The exhibition traveled to the CAAM in the Canary Islands in early 2015.
Later in 2015 the traveling print component from his retrospective Palimpsesto Canibal opened at Instituto de Artes Graficas de Oaxaca IAGO, and traveled to the Museo Nacional de la Estampa MUNAE in Mexico City in the winter of 2016. The same year he had a solo exhibition of paintings and works on paper Recent Work by Enrique Chagoya at Anglim Gilbert Gallery in San Francisco, California.

Eddie Chambers,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/eddie-chambers/,"Eddie Chambers was born in Wolverhampton, and currently lives between Bristol, England, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Austin, Texas. His education includes a BA (Hons) in Fine Art from Sunderland Polytechnic, awarded in 1983, and a Ph.D in Art History, from Goldsmiths College, University of London, awarded in 1998. Eddie Chambers’ Ph.D. was awarded for his doctoral study into ‘Black Visual Arts Activity in England Between 1981 – 1986: Press and Public Responses’.
Since the early 1980s he has been involved in first organising, then curating, a considerable number of artists’ exhibitions in the United Kingdom, as well as in a number of other countries. These exhibitions began with ‘Black Art an’ done’ at Wolverhampton Art Gallery in 1981. Subsequent exhibitions included ‘D-Max: A Photographic Exhibition’ (1987), ‘Black Art: Plotting the Course’ (1988). In the 1990s, his exhibitions included, ‘Let The Canvas Come to Life with Dark Faces’ (1990), ‘History and Identity: Seven Painters (1991), ‘Four x 4’ (1991), ‘The Dub Factor’ (1992). ‘Black People and the British Flag’ (1993), ‘Eugene Palmer (1993), ‘Home & Away’ (1994), ‘Us an’ Dem’ (1994), ‘Phaophanit & Piper’ (1995), ‘Frank Bowling: Bowling on Through the Century’ (1996), and ‘Tam Joseph: This is History’ (1998).

His writings have also appeared in publications such as, Race Today, Africa World Review, Circa, Creative Camera, Ten.8, Artists Newsletter and the Greater London Arts Quarterly. The Institute of International Visual Arts (INIVA) as part of their ‘Annotations’ series published a collection of his articles, reviews, and essays, Run Through the Jungle in February 1999.
As a visual artist, he has also had a number of exhibitions of his own work – both solo and group exhibitions – in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. These have included ‘The Black Bastard as a Cultural Icon’ (1985), ‘The Slaughter of Another Golden Calf’ (1984/85), and ‘Marcus Garvey: The Blackest Star’ (1988).

He coordinated AAVAA for several years, until the autumn of 1992. Two decades later, AAVAA was de-accessioned by the University of East London and the material returned to Eddie Chambers. The material is currently being incorporated into Eddie Chambers’ ongoing archival project.

Kashif Nadim Chaudry,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/kashif-nadim-chaudry/,"Kashif Nadim Chaudry is a Nottingham born artist, of Punjabi origin, living and working in the East Midlands. He studied Textiles at Goldsmiths College, London, graduating in 2005 and has continued to develop a textile orientated practice. A family heritage in tailoring has been very influential for Chaudry’s work and has focused his creativity around the importance of materiality and craftsmanship. The heart of his practice lies with the working, shaping and moulding of physical ‘stuff’.
Negotiating his sexuality as a gay man, within different cultural and religious spheres, has been a fertile ground from which Chaudry’s practice has taken root and from which he continuously draws inspiration. This ‘negotiation’ has often translated literally into physical space, grounded in a question of how one chooses to position themself in the world. Increasingly, it is through the sculptural and three-dimensional possibilities within his work that Chaudry addresses these issues of space and position.
Chaudry is in awe of the monumental, the majestic and the sacred; from Neolithic architecture to the Taj Mahal. He draws upon the vastness of historical cultures and their associated artefacts for inspiration. Closer to home, it is the colourful and sensual fabrics of South Asia that have always brought him joy and continue to embroider his practice. Chaudry is fascinated with embellishment, adornment and decoration, including how these techniques can be viewed as creating surfaces and skins. What interests Chaudry, specifically, is the immediate dichotomy created by a surface and of what lies below; of how the artifice of a patina can elicit a desire to delve beneath.
A growing awareness of the intersections of his identity have brought Chaudry to this point in his practice. Whether British, Pakistani, Muslim or Gay, a deeper and closer scrutiny of their interplay has made him aware of the ‘performance’ of living. He sees the narrative of our lives – which we edit and shape daily – as being clothed in a multitude of surfaces, both literal and metaphysical. And he is interested in what happens when these surfaces collide; of the transgressive identities, the ruptures and the ripples these create.
From an art historical perspective, it is the flamboyance of the Baroque which captures Chaudry’s imagination, as well as the grand narratives of religion and ceremony.  A re-imagining of these sacred cows through the lens of a Queer man, has given his practice a wry tinge and coupled with this, he firmly believes in art’s capacity to entertain and be fabulous.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/final_dp2_28-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Adam Chodzko,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/adam-chodzko/,"Adam Chodzko is an artist working across media, exploring our conscious and unconscious behaviours, social relations and collective imaginations through artworks created as speculative forms of ‘social media.’ Exhibiting his work nationally and internationally since 1991 Chodzko’s practice asks ‘what might we be becoming?’ by examining ways in which the visual might enhance our perception in order to create better connections with others.
His artworks includes video, installation, photography, socially engaged practices, drawing and performance. Bringing together fragments from diverse fields of knowledge to make work that sits between documentary and fiction, his artworks are propositions driven by the question; if this is our current reality together then what, really, should happen to us next?
Chodzko’s exhibitions range from a solo survey show at Tate St Ives to major installations at Tate Britain, MAMBo and Raven Row and commissions range from Creative Time, NY to the Wellcome Trust. He has had work in the Venice, Istanbul, Athens, Whitstable and Folkestone Bienniales/Trienniales and has received awards from the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, New York, the AHRC, and in 2015 was shortlisted for the Jarman Award.

Kyungwoo Chun,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/kyungwoo-chun/,"Kyungwoo Chun (*1969 in Seoul) has for many years now been working on photography projects and initiating performances in which the audience is actively involved. Chun attained international recognition through his portraits, many of which have a characteristic blurriness in their movements-the consequence of extended exposure times. As diverse as the artistic approaches seem at a first glance, Chun considers both the performances and the photographs to be in equal measure “visible manifestations of that which is not visible.”
Ever since early 2000s, performance works have arisen in parallel to the photography. These are temporally limited processes which can be carried out individually or as a group. As author and initiator, Chun withdraws to a large extent into the background. He establishes a framework in which the participants can act independently. They generally have the possibility of leaving behind something of their own. Sometimes it is a personal object, a photograph, or just the answer to a question. In other cases, their physical presence is already sufficient.The sensitization to an altered perception of time and the intensification of a dialogue with oneself and with others are essential aspects of this artistic practice.
The oeuvre of Kyungwoo Chun has been presented in many solo and group exhibitions in Europe and Korea. Furthermore, he has realized numerous performances with participation of the public in many cities including Barcelona, Seoul, Berlin, Liverpool, Zurich, Mumbai, Bremen and New York. The artist’s work is represented in major museum collections including the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston(MFAH), Huis Marseille stichting voor fotografie in Amsterdam, Kunsthalle Emden, Museet for Fotokunst Odense, Musée Mac/Val in Vitry-sur-Seine, The Museum of Photography Seoul, National Museum of Contemporary Art in Korea(MMCA) among others.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/themes/icf/assets/images/placeholder.png,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Carefully marrying concept with materiality, she moves slowly between performance, installation, experimental art writing, exhibition making, moving image, research and photography. Her autobiographical, autoethnographic and therapeutic (“autoethnotherapeutic”) approach is a meditation on celebration, commemoration and tribute. Through archival research, reactivation and socialisation, she centres on lived experience while striking through and reframing past and present dominant narratives. She offers her creativity as calls to action for heritage work to include ethical cultural memory and collective intelligence. Her work is an invitation to convene and proposition our futurities.
Craig is a member of the social history and curatorial collective Rita Keegan Archive Project (RKAP). Recent exhibitions include Between There and Here at South London Gallery (2021) and No Loose Strands at the Feminist Library, London (2022). RKAP’s upcoming project is a collaboration with William Morris Gallery and Liberty department store as a response to the Althea McNish’s exhibition, Colour is Mine (2022).
Craig’s current project Rendering Experience proposes a re-appraisal of Passion: Discourses on Blackwomen’s Creativity (1990), edited by Maud Sulter. Grounded in the present, the research questions the text’s visibility, urgency and art-historical impact on curatorial futures. Craig’s previous encounters with Passion include a Maud Sulter study day with Glasgow International and Rhubaba Gallery and Studios, Edinburgh, Oral history Training, Absence/Presence a project about Maud Sulter as part of the Open the Door festival by Glasgow Women’s Library. Lauren encouraged dialogue around the book by exhibiting it in Rita Keegan Archive (Project) at South London Gallery (2020) and Show and Tell, The Women’s Art Library (2015).

In 1999 Darsi began developing work on and with gilding, using golden adhesive as his material of choice for covering objects—dolls, a garden chair, a television, tanks, teeth…but also public spaces, including, notably, the façade of an art gallery in Casablanca in 2007, the concrete blocks of the pier on the port of Guia de Isora in Tenerife in 2008 and those on the port of Marseille in 2012. In 2001, he started the series “Portraits de famille” in which, from 2001 to 2007, the inhabitants of seven cities around the world were invited to pose in his mobile studio. The Hermitage Park project, developed in the form of “artistic bridges” from 2002 to 2008, marked the beginning of a series of actions and projects engaged with questions about the city, architecture and public spaces: “Le lion se meurt,” “Le passage de la modernité,” “Le square d’en bas,” “Point zéro,” “Le toit du monde,” “Chantiers en or”… Along with these projects, he has participated in numerous international exhibitions in art centers, museums and biennales.

Fascinated by complex possibilities lying dormant in ‘familiar’ environments, setting a challenging dialogue between cultural identity and the inner worlds which we as artists manifest within our work. This conceptual framework draws parallels between artists from differing socio-cultural worlds, whose work follows similar lines in metaphysical realms. Francis’ interpretation of the curator is that of a caretaker of other worlds, working in collaboration as the tour guide and storyteller, bringing these converging manifestations to our physical spaces.
Francis’ artwork centres around her neurodiverse and queer identity, building her own language and worlds to explore and understand ‘how I made me’; a reference to an early body of work that investigated her inner trauma and re-articulation of her current self.

Ellen Gallagher,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/ellen-gallagher/,"Gallagher builds intricate, multi-layered works that pivot between the natural world, mythology and history. Her process involves undoing and reforming trains of thought often over long periods of time and across linked bodies of works.
Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1965, Ellen Gallagher lives and works between Rotterdam, Netherlands and New York.
Over a highly multifaceted career, Gallagher’s work has been united by what she calls a ‘jitter,’ an intellectual approach in which aesthetic possibilities are shook loose from seismic cracks beneath the surface of cultural entities normally thought to be unshakable and impermeable. Encompassing painting, drawing, collage and celluloid based projections that fuse technique and material into syncretic form, her arresting compositions are a process of recovery and reconstitution through the accumulation and erasure of media, which results in palimpsestic and topographic surfaces that are often carved, inlaid, mounted, printed, blotted and inscribed.
The subtle textures of her work bear witness to a singular process that is materially and conceptually intertwined. Gallagher creates a geographic timeline in which interlocking forms appear to mutate between figuration and abstraction, like agents in a musical composition coming together in an evolving continuum. Gallagher’s work is included in many major international museum collections including MoMA, New York; Albright Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Art Institute of Chicago; MCA Chicago; MOCA, Los Angeles; Philadelphia Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of Art, New York; Tate, London; and Centre Pompidou, Paris.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Diaspora-Pavilion-Ellen-Gallagher-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

She studied BA European Textile Design at Bradford School of Art and Design. She began her career as a knitwear designer in New York.

Lungiswa Gqunta,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/lungiswa-gqunta/,"Lungiswa Gqunta deconstructs spatial modes of exclusion and oppression by addressing the access to and ownership of land, unravelling multisensory experiences that highlight persistent social imbalances – legacies of both patriarchal dominance and colonialism. She aims to disrupt this status quo with material references to guerrilla tactics and protest: her installations consist of quotidian objects with the potential to become weapons and means to defend in the struggle that opposes the slow violence imposed by oppression in relation to labour, racial, class, and gender inequalities. Specifically catering to context and audience, her works provide positive references and care to people of colour, and impose discomfort, confrontation, and caution in white (cube) spaces. Hereby, Gqunta aims to reassert black people into the landscape, shedding light on sedimented knowledge, and thus creating a site for non-traditional forms of excavation in which discovery and erasure are simultaneously present. More so, she counters the PTSD that haunts society and poses forms of collective healing in which music and female strength play a crucial role. These matters are highly relevant in current times: addressing inequality, land ownership, labour, and the pervasive, ongoing legacies of racism.

This produced many group shows of the London art scene including at the V&A, Tate, Shanghai Moganshan and Beijing 798. It culminated with Event Horizon, a three month performative experience at The Royal Academy (2009) including new commissions by Tai Shani, Lindsay Seers, Mark Titchner, Marc Camille Chaimowicz and Spartacus Chetwynd.
Gross’ thinking in experimental curatorial-, economic-, and social models, Artist Urban Action, led to the creation of long-duration Artist Infrastructures: The Old Police Station, Artist Village and Enclave, London (2009>ongoing) – self-sufficient incubators for artist project spaces and entropic social action.

Amy Guo,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/amy-guo/,"Amy Guo is an experimental multimedia installation artist, currently working within the frame of digital technology and glitch. Both experimentation and glitch provoke uncertainty. The digital material and space are explored through her projection works, which could suggest ethereal digital properties contained within the physical world.
Glitch, in Guo’s work, is viewed as an unexpected intervention that prevents the normal function of modern technologies; an apparatus to distort the human perception instead of a critique towards mainstream media, as glitch became more visible in mainstream culture. Objects and sculptures sometimes double as immersive environments or spaces that embody the viewers; thus, both the sculpture and the viewer become disruptions in the artwork. Hence, the viewer transforms into part of the artwork, metaphorically fusing with the digital content.
Guo’s interest in unifying human and digital existence, which offers a common ground between humans and the technical other. In some works, a common ground is established by visualising and combining sounds of both machines and humans using a spectrogram or the vibrations of sounds. Her work comments on the projection of human emotion and intellect onto virtual entities, as the articulation process of the non-human depends on the understanding of our human selves.
The artist’s recent discovery in Maladaptive Daydreaming, a newly researched disorder in excessive daydreaming, instigated a divergence in her art making process by means of free associations.

Gonkar Gyatso,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/gonkar-gyatso/,"Gonkar Gyatso is a Tibetan born British artist who moved to London in the late 90‘s on scholarship to Central St. Martin‘s College of Art and Design. His unique style combines traditional Buddhist iconography with Pop Art and influences from Pop Culture.
Much of Gyatso’s work centres around the reproduction and reinvention of Buddhist iconography and the geometry and aesthetic approach of traditional Tibetan thangka painting. Skilfully weaving western and Tibetan cultural constructs and influences, Gyatso translates Buddha images posed in traditional thangka-influenced compositions into pop imagery that satirises world politics and the mundaneness of life, while creating a space for the coexistence of different cultures.
Gonkar Gyatso’s work comes out of a fascination with material and pop culture and a desire to bring equal attention to the mundane as well as the extraordinary, the imminent and the superfluous. These contradictions are often found in the same piece. His work can be very silly, uncanny, and even ironic and at the same time comes out of concerns that are shaping our times. As his own experience has been one that reflects a kind of hybridity and transformation, his work also holds this quality.

His work explores somatic responses to ideas relating to sound, including but not limited to acoustic levitation, spatialisation, the human as a vessel of sound and the creation of physical and theoretical space. Deeply influenced by music, Hart’s work is a renegotiation of the visual language and legacies of Western abstraction, probing connections between the phenomena, language and representation of sound in painting.

Alexandrina Helmsley,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/alexandrina-helmsley/,"Alexandrina Hemsley’s creative practice lands in the fluid spaces of dance, choreography, writing, facilitating and advocacy. Their interests are both enduring and in expansive states of flux – or just in connection/relation to the processes within life and within living. They turn towards the sensorial, the bodily, the multiple subjective positions of self – and self in intimate relation to self and other selves – as ways to find breath and voice amidst the unjust and inequitable.
They work with intricate improvisation scores and vivid performance environments which insist on conjuring embodied enquiries into a multiplicity of voices. This includes work within organisations around anti-racism, anti-ableism and embodied advocacy. It is a life long, nuanced undertaking.
Alexandrina is currently embarking on a slow-burn interdisciplinary solo project Words Collect In my Mouth; All is Fire and Flood which attends to questions of how, one (individual & communities) returns to intimacy – of self, of performing, of expression – within the aftermaths of (continual) violence? The research situates itself across and does not distinguish aesthetic value between dance, writing, film, healthcare and community work.

Keith Khan,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/keith-khan/,"Keith Khan makes performance, film, drawing and textiles.
Born in London, of Indo-Caribbean heritage, his career began designing carnival in Trinidad and the UK. He links his layered identities: from his families´ distant Indian heritage; being a gay Muslim raised in diverse London; to contemporary phenomenon of cultural confusion; more about the projects, resulting in highly personal projects, often presented in different locations for an audience as diverse as himself.
Keith created a company, called “Moti Roti” which existed from 1989 (closing in 2011) presenting work with diverse audiences, particularly South Asian. They produced a range of thoughtful offerings, grounded in cultural omission or popular tropes. Tropical fish and embroideries were the stars of “Captives” for the Walsall Museum and Art Gallery. “Wigs of Wonderment”, discussed gender, in a one to one experience with a cast of women of colour. “Plain Magic” was presented in tents at Asian melas. The film “Sweet and Spicy” featured animations and interviews with Bangladeshi restaurateurs. Bollywood playback singing underpinned he work “Moti Roti” (created in 1992, toured until 1994). This show won a “Time Out Dance and performance Award”. The theme of cultural masking, from the call centres in Bangalore to North America, featured in “Alladeen” in collaboration with   The Builder´s Association (2002 and toured until 2005). This piece won an OBIE (for Outstanding Production in 2005-2006).
In parallel, Keith used his design and scale skills to create a range of public spectacles, in stadia, streets and buildings. Some were produced under the vehicle of moti roti, many independently. He was the designer for the “Central Show” in the millennium dome, working with Peter Gabriel, Mark Fisher and Robert Lepage. He was the design director of the “Commonwealth games” in Manchester, and staged the “Commonwealth Parade” for The Queen´s Jubilee.
His beliefs in community and education, led him to two positions: first, Chief Executive of Rich Mix, then Head of Culture for the London 2012 Olympic Games. With both he created management and structures that valued community, people and forms of cultural expression outside of institutions. His drive to try and change cultural hegemony resulted in him serving on both on London Arts Board, and for 9 years on the National Council of the Arts Council. In 2014, his back catalogue of archive materials and costumes was acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum. The moti roti archive resides with The National Archive.
Khan´s current works are created from his primary source of displacement. He has made a series of films in China and India featuring artists and cultural commentators talking about their neighbours. He is working on digital platforms with animation. The film Z (Zeta) a film exploring Spanish Catholic religious iconography will be premiered by LADA (Live after Development Agency) in June. His two films, “Chayatantra” and “”Sweet and Spicy” will be released by the BFI later this year.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Fanon-3-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Thomas Kilpper,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/thomas-kilpper/,"Thomas Kilpper was born in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1956. He lives and works in Berlin.
Thomas Kilpper’s work engages with history and politics in a manner that recalls the 1960s in terms of his committed engagement. Typically Kilpper takes over a building and investigates its history, carving into the floor to make woodcuts which he then prints on a large scale onto fabric that floats free when he hangs it. Kilpper’s strategy is to work with buildings condemned for demolition and to use only materials he finds on site to make art. In that respect his work engages with the art of Gordon Matta-Clark but by inscribing himself into the building, rather than simply cutting it up, he puts forward a different point of view. He has no studio, is constantly on the move and starts each project from scratch. Research is a fundamental tool of his practice and the result is normally an artistic intervention into politics and history. Thus Kilpper combines a strong conceptual basis with considerable technical skill in making images that have dramatic impact and presence.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BB6_Petrit_Halilaj_15_300dpi-768x555.jpeg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

John Lyons,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/john-lyons/,"John Lyons is a painter and poet, born in 1933 in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. When he was nine, his mother died after a short illness and he and his three siblings moved to rural Tobago to live with his grandmother. There, he discovered and sought refuge in the works of Walter Scott, Conan Doyle, and other authors he was able to find in the library in Scarborough. In 1948 Lyons returned to Trinidad to live with his father and stepmother. After successfully passing the Senior Cambridge exam, Lyons had to forego further study to lessen the financial burden on his family. He passed the Civil Service entrance examination and worked for five years in the Civil Service, during which time he continued with his passion for writing and painting.
​In 1959 Lyons was accepted into Goldsmiths College in London, and graduated in 1964 with a National Diploma of Design. He gained an Art Teachers’ Diploma at the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1965; his first job was at South Shields Grammar Technical School for Boys. In 1967 he moved to Manchester where he worked in secondary schools for nine years, before becoming an Art and Design lecturer in South Trafford College. He taught at the college for seventeen years, all the time continuing with his writing and painting. In 1987 Lyons won a number of poetry prizes: second prize in the Cultureword Poetry Competition; the Peterloo Poets Afro-Caribbean and Asian prize; a commendation in the National Poetry Competition, and in the Peterloo Poetry Competition.
​Lyons was co-founder of the Hourglass Studio Gallery in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, where he directed art and Creative Writing workshops with his partner Jean Rees. The arts educational arm of the organisation became a charity, and he remained on the Board of Trustees until 2009, when it lost its Art Council funding in the general cuts.
​Lyons first full collection of poems, Lure of the Cascadura, was published in 1989 by Bogle L’Ouverture Publications, for which he received a major Arts Council award. In 2003 he was given the Windrush Arts Achiever Award. Aside from his numerous contributions to poetry anthologies, he has 8 published poetry collections, the most recent being: A Carib Being in Cymru and Dancing in the Rain, both in 2015.
​Lyons has been exhibiting his paintings since the 1960s and describes his approach to picture making as: “I enter into a playful dialogue with the work in which line, shape, texture and vibrant colour are brought together to inhabit a theme usually based on Caribbean folklore and mythology.” He was a participant in the exhibition ‘No Colour Bar: Black British Art in Action 1960–1990’ at the Guildhall Art Gallery, which took inspiration from the radical lives of Guyanese activists Eric and Jessica Huntley and the publishing company they founded, Bogle-L’Ouverture. Lyons also had several paintings included in the critically acclaimed exhibition ‘Life Between Islands: Caribbean – British Art 1950s – Now’ held at Tate Britain in 2021-22.
​A number of public collections hold artwork by John Lyons including Rochdale Art Gallery, Huddersfield Art Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Word & Image Print Collection and the Arts Council National Collection.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/John-Lyons-Andrew-Pierre-Hart-Black-Cultural-Archives-2022-e1669290871566-768x449.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

She completed a degree in Visual Arts and a Master degree in Institutional Psychology at Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Her artwork is a hybrid practice across performance, video, installation and text, occasionally flirting with drawing and collage. She is attracted by states of synergy, encompassing the invisible relationships of affect and flux, and investigates the body in order to amplify the possibilities of perception beyond the habitual. By doing so, she is constantly re-elaborating her personal notion of existential territories (spatial, temporal, cognitive, social and political). More recently, she has been researching the concept of memory and its relationship with language and channeling, often making use of personal narratives as a device for action and resilience. Since 2018 she has been working on the creation of a ‘Book-Performance’, a series of actions in response to specific autobiographical texts particularly influenced by experiences of racism and misogyny.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/048_HD_180906_4583_©-Hydar-Dewachi-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Recent projects have focused on the shame and stigma of mental health difficulties and disability, the pressures and violence of inner-city life from the perspective of young people and the joy of music and dancing.
Djofray works predominantly in moving-image, bringing together different techniques combining stop-motion animation, video footage and hand drawn/painted elements which are sometimes presented alongside live performances or dance. Each element of the work is carefully self-made, from hand built sets and hand stitched garments for Claymation characters, to soundtracks that are developed closely with Djofray’s brother

In 2020, Djofray won a Goldsmiths Exhibitions Hub commission, in partnership with the London Community Video Archive, to make Hello Mr Officer, a moving image work that sees young Black men from across London share their experiences of being harassed by the police.

Mohau Modisakeng,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/mohau-modisakeng/,"Material, metaphor and the black body are the tools that Mohau Modisakeng uses to explore the influence of South Africa’s violent history that has been ignored in today’s society, on how we understand our cultural, political, and social roles as human beings in post-colonial Africa and in particular post-apartheid South Africa. Represented through film, large-scale photographic prints, installations and performances, his “work doesn’t start off with an attempt to portray violence but it becomes mesmerising because although we might recognise history as our past, the body is indifferent to social changes, so it remembers.”
Mohau Modisakeng was born in Soweto in 1986 and lives and works between Johannesburg and Cape Town. He completed his undergraduate degree at the Michaelis School of Fine Art, Cape Town in 2009 and worked towards his Master’s degree at the same institution. His work engages race, the militarisation of society and the deep divides of post-apartheid South Africa and the post-colonial continent. He interrogates the collective narratives that inform our experience of the world, in particular those that evoke the black body as a site of fragmentation and distortion.
Modisakeng was finalist in the MTN New Contemporaries in 2010, awarded the Sasol New Signatures Award for 2011, Standard Bank Artist of the year (VISUAL ART) 2016. He has also represented South Africa at the South African Pavilion at 56th and 57th Venice Biennial in 2015 and 2017. Modisakeng has also presented commissioned projects for Performa Biennialle in 2017 and Sharjah Bienniale in 2019.

She explores these issues through the use of pattern and textile. The patterns she designs are inspired by the Islamic Design Principles, such as those of recurrence, symmetry and abstraction. The use of textile is an important aspect of her work as textile has evolved from being a craft concerned with the domestic to being reclaimed by women artists, re-establishing textiles as an art-form within a patriarchal narrative.

Graeme Evelyn Mortimer,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/graeme-evelyn-mortimer/,"Graeme Mortimer Evelyn is a multi-media visual artist, musician, and curator – whose varied body of work comments on cultural social identity, politics, and language. His works have been displayed and collected in Princeton University Center for African American Studies NJ, Cornell University NY, Kensington Palace, The Royal Commonwealth Society, Museum in Docklands, Gloucester Cathedral, Watershed, and M-Shed Bristol.
Evelyn has developed a reputation for creating work that is situated in municipal buildings, sites of memory and places of worship that subvert these settings and philosophies. His intention is that his art acts as a catalyst – attracting new audiences to seek alternative dialogues and challenging questions to enable the democracy of public space. His subversion of the institution does not stop there, as his works often reflect that ‘institution” denotes systems, memorial, edifice, myth, belief, and popular opinion.
Many of the commissioned project work engages with contested histories and heritage, which has often required detailed archival research and an acute sensitivity to collective social issues and ideas. This process is challenging and thought-provoking for both artist and audience, causing to question the essence of what brings people into a conversation with a work of contemporary art.
Evelyn co-curated the major landmark UK exhibition Jamaican Pulse – Art and Politics from Jamaica and the Diaspora – commissioned by The Royal West of England Academy for June 25 – Sept 11 2016, in partnership with the Jamaican High Commission, National Gallery of Jamaica and The Bluecoat Liverpool supported by Arts Council England.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_3831-768x431.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

She frequently looks to the history of art, obscuring and subverting dominant imagery found in the accepted canon to form alternate readings.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/farwamoledina_interwovendetail_2018-1500x1000-1-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

He currently lives and works in Martinique. After studying visual communication in Paris, he has majored in special education for children in danger and become a professional in this field. He is also a plastician.
Since their inception, his artworks have combined the discovery and exploration of visual arts as well as the appropriation of ritual Afro-Caribbean drumbeat.
The artist has been deeply influenced by pre-Columbian archaeology, which has had a lasting aesthetic impact on his artistic work. His plastic expression has been subjected to continuous renewal over the last few years, and has tapped into the singularity of his imaginative sources.
When composing his pieces, Ricardo uses automatic drawing and painting, a practice that has driven him to a graphic trance allowing him to verbalize rhythms, sensations and inner tensions.
He transcribes the contours of his “topography of the inner world”, giving a free space of expression to the multiple influences that animate his creation and which, through the tracings of bi-chromic blacks and whites, reveal the hybrid characters welling up from his syncretic imagination that are named the “Intercessors”.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Barbados-Martinique-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Working in visual arts, architecture, theory and curatorial practices, Park incorporates text, photography, video, installation and new media into his works, a practice that is rooted in research, participation and activism in public spaces. For Park, art is a process of inquiry, examination and articulation of cultures, and a visual language of communication rather than a commodity of productions. His first project was the founding of StoreFront for Art and Architecture in New York, an internationally respected exhibition space that he directed from 1982-1998. He then founded International Center for Urban Ecology in Detroit, producing workshops, urban initiatives and videos, in collaboration with activists, community organizations and universities [1998-2001]. They include: “Detroit Making It Better For You,” a narrative video on a fictional conspiracy to destroy the city [2000]; and “24260: The Fugitive House,” a vacant house that ‘escaped’ Detroit to travel ten cities in Europe [2001-2008]. Since then, he has traveled and worked in various cities in Europe, developing a nomadic practice on urban investigation. The results were: “The Slide,” a proposal to build a transparent tube that people can slide through in an empty high-rise building in Halle Neustadt, and “BAR/GDR/FRG,” a 3-channel video on the three different ideological cities within Dresden, both projects in Germany [2003]. He was also a co-curator and artist for Shrinking Cities in Berlin [2002-2004], and the founding director of Centrala Foundation for Future Cities in Rotterdam in The Netherlands [2005]. There, he co-produced “Lost Highway Expedition,” an expedition through nine major cities of ex-Yugoslavia and Albania in 25 days, in which several hundred people participated [2006]. His current project is “New Silk Roads,” a series of expeditions between Istanbul and Tokyo, focusing on the relational conditions of Asian cities within the geography of globalization, which was presented in a solo exhibition at Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Castilla y León in 2009-2010, along with the publication of a monograph on this project with Actar in Barcelona expected in 2011.

Lynn Parotti,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/lynn-parotti/,"Lynn Parotti is preoccupied with the environment in all its multifaceted connotations. She has a consuming passion for the natural landscape of the Bahamas where she was born, particularly the intoxicating world of the ocean. But she is equally concerned with the social geography of place; the human experience and relationship to these locations, the historical traces, the economic and environmental impact and consequences. Her sensuous revelling in the beauty of nature is increasingly counter-balanced by a politicised awareness of its imperilled state due to climate change and the attendant crises of rising sea levels, the depletion of natural resources, the consequences of coral bleaching, the availability of clean water. She also references the human toll through allusions to migration, coastal communities, substance fishing and poverty.
Lynn Parotti first studied painting at the State University of New York at Purchase where she received a BFA in 1990. She participated in the Artist’s Residency, Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine in 1992 and subsequently completed an MFA in Painting and Printmaking at the Virginia Commonwealth University in 1993.

Richard J. Powell,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/richard-j-powell/,"Richard J. Powell, a recognized authority on African American art and culture (and a frequent lecturer and media commentator on this topic both in the United States and abroad), has organized numerous art exhibitions, most notably: The Blues Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism (1989); Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance (1997); To Conserve A Legacy: American Art at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (1999); Back to Black: Art, Cinema, and the Racial Imaginary (2005); and Archibald Motley: Jazz Age Modernist (2014). Among the major museums where his curated exhibitions have been presented are the Phillips Academy’s Addison Gallery of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the New Orleans Museum of Art, London’s Whitechapel Art Gallery, and the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Richard J. Powell is the John Spencer Bassett Professor of Art & Art History at Duke University, where he has taught since 1989. After receiving his B.A. at Morehouse College, he earned the M.F.A. (with a specialization in Printmaking) from Howard University. Shortly thereafter Powell completed a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in Museum Education at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art and, after a brief teaching stint in Virginia, he entered Yale University, where he received the M.A. in African American Studies and the M.Phil. and Ph.D. in the History of Art. While attending Yale, Powell was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship, which enabled him to conduct dissertation research in Copenhagen’s National Museum of Denmark and throughout several Scandinavian countries.
It was during Powell’s time at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that he became interested in art criticism and organizing art exhibitions. In 1979 the Studio Museum in Harlem enlisted Powell as guest curator for Impressions/Expressions: Black American Graphics, one of the first art museum surveys of works by African American printmakers. After Powell’s year in Denmark, he settled in Washington, D.C. where, while completing his dissertation under the auspices of the Smithsonian American Art Museum, he became Director of Programs for the Washington Project for the Arts (WPA): one of several alternative art spaces in the 1980s whose contemporary exhibitions and programs fueled that era’s “culture wars.” Powell’s curatorial contributions to this historical moment ranged from a retrospective exhibition of the Washington, D.C.-based Harlem Renaissance artist James Lesesne Wells, to arranging cutting edge art installations and performances by conceptual artist David Hammons, poet/gay activist Essex Hemphill, and legendary dancer/choreographer Katherine Dunham.
As a visual artist, Powell has exhibited his prints and drawings in group and solo exhibitions in the U.S. and abroad and, in the 1980s, worked as a periodical and book illustrator, most notably for: The Massachusetts Review; Callaloo; Roseann Bell, Bettye Parker and Beverly Guy Sheftall’s Sturdy Black Bridges: Visions of Black Women in Literature (1979); and Jessica Hagedorn’s Pet Food and Tropical Apparitions (1981). His works are in the permanent collections of the Bradford Art Galleries and Museums (Bradford, UK), the Library of Congress, the Yale University Art Gallery, and in many private hands. His current art project is an illustrated, art historically themed novel.
Along with teaching courses in American art, the arts of the African Diaspora, and contemporary visual studies, he has written extensively on topics ranging from primitivism to postmodernism, including such titles as Homecoming: The Art and Life of William H. Johnson (1991), Black Art: A Cultural History (1997, 2002, & 2021), Cutting a Figure: Fashioning Black Portraiture (2008), and Going There: Black Visual Satire (2020). From 2007 until 2010, Powell was Editor-in-Chief of The Art Bulletin, the world’s leading English language journal in art history. In 2013 Powell received the Lawrence A. Fleischman Award for Scholarly Excellence in the Field of American Art History from the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art, and in 2016 was honored at the College Art Association’s Annual Conference as the year’s most Distinguished Scholar. In 2018 Powell was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 2021 he was offered membership in the American Philosophical Society.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/BDVA-768x512.jpeg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

His interdisciplinary practice uses citations of Western art history and literature to question the validity of contemporary cultural and national identities within the context of globalisation.

In 2004, he was nominated for the Turner Prize and in 2008, his mid-career survey began at Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, travelling in 2009 to the Brooklyn Museum, New York and the Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institute, Washington D.C.

Joanna Rajkowska,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/joanna-rajkowska/,"Joanna Rajkowska, born in 1968, Bydgoszcz, Poland, is an artist based in Warsaw and London.
Rajkowska studied at the Academy of Fine Arts, Kraków, Poland, graduating with a Master’s Degree in mural painting in 1993, having already obtained an MA in History of Art from the Jagiellonian University in Kraków a year earlier. She extended her education at the State University of New York, participating in the Studio Semester Programme in 1994 and 1995.
A versatile artist, Rajkowska is best known for her work in public space, where she uses real-life situations, energies, organisms and materials to construct sites, installations and ephemeral actions. She utilises elements as diverse as plants, buildings, found objects, water, smoke or sound. De-familiarizing, de-humanizing and relating are her operating devices. She is interested in the limitations and the limiting of human activities, multiplicity of agencies and human and non-human relations.
The outcomes of her works range from urban axes and architectural projects, through geological fantasies, excavation sites to underwater sculptures. Both alongside and separately, she produces films, photographs and models.
Most of her works happen, live and age in public space. Thus, her practice embraces all the entities involved as well as their relations, including organic and inorganic beings. The artist understands her projects like organisms, as she focuses on matter in its molecular or cellular dimension, its life cycle, growth and ageing. With a strong conviction that we, as humans, have failed to produce a viable, sustainable culture, she often confronts historical and sociopolitical contexts with the lives of species other than human. Tinted with disappointment, her work visualizes and questions the notion of the nature-culture divide.
As a woman and a mother, she uses her own body, a biological machine and a tool that enables her to sense and understand the conditions set for her work. Disease, weakness and malfunction of the living body is very often in the backdrop of her work, providing a fertile ground of potentiality rather than failure. The introduction of the weak, the feminine and the limited into the public space, crossing the boundaries between the private and the public has been the most controversial edge of her practice.
Her work has been presented in the UK, Germany, Poland, France, Switzerland, Brazil, Sweden, USA, Bulgaria, Palestine, India, Japan, Turkey and Kenya among others.Her public projects include commissions by Frieze Sculpture 2019 (2019, The Hatchling, UK), United Nations Environment Programme (2019, Death of the Palm Tree, Poland), European Capital of Culture Wrocław (2016, Trafostation, Poland), Institute for Contemporary Ideas and Art (2014, Carpet, Sweden), Royal Society of Arts, Citizen Power Peterborough programme’s Arts and Social Change, Arts Council England (2012, The Peterborough Child, UK), Frieze Projects 2012 (2012, Forcing a Miracle, UK), 7th Berlin Biennale (2012, Born in Berlin, Germany), The Showroom (2010, Chariot, UK), British Council (2010, Benjamin in Konya, Turkey), Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw (2009, Ravine, Poland), CSW Zamek Ujazdowski (2007, Oxygenator, Poland), Trafo Gallery (2008, Airways, Hungary).
As well as commissions, she has realized a number of partisan public projects, most notably Greetings from Jerusalem Avenue in Warsaw (2002) which shaped the unique set of methods Rajkowska employs. The project was to become a major city landmark and has acted as a base for numerous political actions ranging from nurses’ protests to expression of solidarity with Ukraine during its invasion.
Her artwork has been presented in the UK, Germany, Poland, France, Switzerland, Brazil, Sweden, USA, Bulgaria, Palestine, India, Japan, Turkey and Kenya among others.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_7544-e1537281654346-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Jacques Rancière,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/jacques-ranciere/,"Jacques Rancière (b. 1940) is a French philosopher and professor of philosophy at The European Graduate School / EGS, professor emeritus at the Université de Paris, VIII.
Rancière was educated at the École Normale Supérieure, where he was a student of Louis Althusser. With his professor, and other students of Althusser, namely Étienne Balibar, Roger Establet, and Pierre Macherey, he composed and published the seminal Lire le capital, in 1965. Over the next few years, like many of Althusser’s students, Rancière was an active member of the Union des Étudiants Communistes, and constituted the famous cercle d’Ulm, out of which came the now canonical Cahiers Marxistes-Léninistes and Cahiers pour l’Analyse. By 1974, however, Rancière formally broke away from his professor, a theoretical break that culminated in the publication: Althusser’s Lesson. In the same year, Rancière co-founded the journal Révoltes logiques.
Since the publication of Althusser’s Lesson, Rancière has published numerous books, including: The Nights of Labour: The Workers’ Dream in Nineteenth-Century France, The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation, The Names of History: On the Poetics of Knowledge, On the Shores of Politics, Disagreement: Politics and Philosophy, Short Voyages to the Land of the People, The Politics of Aesthetics: The Distribution of the Sensible, The Philosopher and his Poor, The Future of the Image, Hatred of Democracy, The Aesthetic Unconscious, The Emancipated Spectator, The Politics of Literature, Staging the People: The Proletarian and His Double, Mute Speech: Literature, Critical Theory, and Politics, Aisthesis: Scenes from the Aesthetic Regime of Art, and Béla Tarr, the Time After.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Venice-2007-panel-768x454.png,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771
Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/araya-rasdjarmrearnsook/,"Araya Rasdjarmrearnsook was born in Trad, Thailand, in 1957. After earning both a BFA and an MFA in graphic arts from Silpakorn University, Bangkok, she continued her studies in Germany at the Hochschule für Bildende Künste Braunschweig, receiving a diploma in 1990 and an MA in 1994. Around 1998, after early experiments with intaglio printmaking and sculptural installation, Rasdjarmrearnsook began to concentrate on film and video. Her work is an articulation of personal loss and the movement between life and death, approached in a way that challenges viewers’ moral sense and tolerance through complex and provocative imagery.
In Rasdjarmrearnsook’s film The Class (2005), the artist is shown directing a tutorial to a classroom of six corpses, which are shrouded in white sheets and arranged side-by-side on silver morgue trays. Confronting the diversity of cultural and religious attitudes toward mortality, the work also satirizes academic convention, the living professor teaching death to an audience already well versed in the subject. Two Planets (2007–08), a quartet of video vignettes, takes on the conventions and assumptions of western art appreciation. Deep in the Thai countryside, a group of people is presented with reproductions of 19th-century European masterpieces. The subjects sit with their backs to the camera and their untutored dialogue is subtitled in English. Their responses reveal myriad social and cultural nuances, while their perspectives on the works are entirely lacking in pretention. Exploring the interactions between opposing but connected realms—life and death, human and animal, conditioned and unconditioned—Rasdjarmrearnsook presents a meditative rethinking of the meaning of periphery.
Rasdjarmrearnsook’s work has been installed in solo presentations at international institutions including the National Gallery, Bangkok (1987, 1992, 1994, 1995, and 2002); Tensta Konsthall, Stockholm (2003); Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach (2012); and Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (2012). In addition to regular appearances at biennials and other periodic exhibitions including the Sydney Biennial (1996 and 2010), Istanbul Biennial (2003), and Documenta 13 (2012), the artist’s work has also been shown in group exhibitions internationally, at venues including the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki (2001 and 2007); Fine Arts Museum, Berne, Switzerland (2006); National Art Gallery, Singapore (2010); National Museum of Art, Osaka (2011); and Asian Art Museum of San Francisco (2012).

He was a leading figure in Britain's BLK Art Group of the 1980s. Rodney's work appropriated images from the mass media, art and popular culture to explore issues of racial identity and racism.
Rodney was born and raised in Birmingham, England. He completed a pre-degree course at Bournville School of Art and went on to complete an honours degree in Fine Art at Trent Polytechnic in Nottingham, graduating in the mid-1980s. There, he met Keith Piper, also from Birmingham. Piper was to influence Rodney’s work towards more political themes. The works of Rodney and Piper, alongside Eddie Chambers, Marlene Smith and Claudette Johnson became recognised as a distinct movement within British art, known as the BLK Art Group, whose attachments were to social and political narratives. In 1987, Rodney completed a Postgraduate Diploma in Multi-Media Fine Art at University College London’s Slade School of Fine Art.
Rodney had 6 solo exhibitions stemming from 1985-1997. He also showed and participated in numerous other exhibitions and residencies across this period.

Khadija Saye,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/khadija-saye/,"Khadija Saye was a contemporary artist working with a variety of photographic processes. Born and raised in London, she completed a BA in Photography at University for the Creative Arts, Farnham.
Coming from a mixed faith and multi cultural background influenced her practice to be an ongoing exploration of identity and how we utilise our unique perspectives to create change within our communities and further afield. This conflicting and corresponding nature of life was vital to the way she engaged with photography, questioning the hybrid embrace of history, culture and spirituality. Saye’s practice explores political and social issues alongside concepts of race, gender and cultural aesthetics. Her work frequently involves cultural exchanges and intercultural connection, taking a personal and intimate approach to connecting and communicating with other cultures and individuals. These works range from unconventional styles of representation and formal portrait techniques to works that embody and characterise her cultural experiences. The idea of dialogue and shifting perspectives is integral to Saye’s work, connecting the broader social questions to the creative process. Her work seeks to give expression to the human visual instinct that can function at levels uninviting to spoken or literary expression. Using the lens of an interconnected world, Saye’s subjects take on a fresh light, a collective truth about the human soul and our relationship in a global international community.
On 14 June 2017 we lost Khadija in the Grenfell Tower fire. We at ICF first met Khadija in 2015 where she participated in our Tactical Interventions trip to the Venice Biennale and we were inspired by her optimism and dedication to her practice, and at that moment it felt almost logical that she should be one of the artists exhibiting in the 2016-8 Diaspora Pavilion programme.

Shot in Tel Aviv, their short videos report contradictions of a society defined by power relations, commonly featuring subjects like artists and models, men and women, and the private and public domain. Their films offer a fresh examination of the influence of occupation, terror, and the army in Israeli identity. Even in the most private moments, sexual identity and political identity are inextricably linked in their works. For their latest project “Exterritory,” the two artists left their cameras in distinct locations to collectively investigate space beyond borders in different neighboring countries at war. This utopian project exists only in a temporary situation, a place located in transit across the maritime horizons. There, Maayan Amir and Ruti Sela, other artists and curators, met to develop a film program centering on the concept of extraterritoriality. The first program “Exterritory” was held June 17 to 21, 2010, (coincidentally a few days after the Israeli attack of the fleet on its way to Gaza) on a ship that traveled from Israel to Cyprus.

Wael Shawky,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/wael-shawky/,"Based on extensive periods of research and enquiry, Wael Shawky’s work tackles notions of national, religious and artistic identity through film, performance and storytelling. Whether instructing Bedouin children to act out the construction of an airport runway in the desert or organizing a heavy metal concert in a remote Egyptian village, Shawky frames contemporary culture through the lens of historical tradition and vice versa. Mixing truth and fiction, childlike wonder and spiritual doctrine, Shawky has staged epic recreations of the medieval clashes between Muslims and Christians in his trilogy of puppets and marionettes – titled Cabaret Crusades: The Horror Show Files (2010), The Path to Cairo (2012) and The Secrets of Karbala (2015) – while his three-part film, Al Araba Al Madfuna, uses child actors to recount poetic myths, paying homage, rather than mere lip-service, to the important narratives of yesteryear.

Recently she has focused particularly on themes of diaspora, exile and the slippage between home, belonging and location. Less theoretically, she is interested in the innovative role art professionals might play in local communities while maintaining crucial connections to internationally relevant dialogues in contemporary art. Kasia holds a BA (Hons) degree in Art History from Goldsmiths College and an MA in Culture, Criticism and Curation from Central St Martin’s, London.

Shirley J. Thompson,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/shirley-thompson/,"Shirley J. Thompson is a composer, conductor, violinist, academic and artistic director.
Her music is performed and screened worldwide and often described as “beautiful and powerful” (Le Figaro). A visionary artist and cultural activist, Thompson is the first woman in Europe to have composed and conducted a symphony within the last 40 years. New Nation Rising, A 21st Century Symphony performed and recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is an epic musical story celebrating London’s thousand-year history, and one in which the RPO is accompanied by two choirs, solo singers, a rapper and dhol drummers, a total of nearly 200 performers. This extraordinary work was originally commissioned for the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the concept was latterly assumed as a framework for the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony. She has also composed extensively for TV/film, theatre, dance and opera production.
Thompson’s musical experience began with her playing the violin for various youth symphony orchestras in London, as well as choral singing with local choirs. After studying Musicology at the University of Liverpool and then specialising in Composition at Goldsmiths’ College with, Professor Stanley Glasser, her first major commission came from the Greenwich International Festival, when she composed a chamber orchestral work entitled Visions
After writing several instrumental and vocal ensemble pieces, Thompson started writing for film and television. Her music for the major BBC drama series, South of the Border was selected as a Top 20 BBC TV Theme in 1990 and her score for the film, Dreaming Rivers, earned a prize at the Mannheim Film Festival in that year. She subsequently composed music for a number of television documentaries and drama programmes.
In 1995 she launched and directed The Shirley Thompson Ensemble at London’s South Bank Centre, her own ensemble of instrumental soloists, singers, dancers and visual artists. It was with this group that she created ground-breaking compositions which seamlessly integrate contemporary classical music orchestration with improvisation, as well as fusing contemporary popular music and world music styles. She also developed compositions that integrated video imagery and contemporary dance for the concert stage. Through her original compositions she has subsequently become a leading exponent of music performance with multi-media and has devised innovative arts education programmes including the exemplary, Newham Symphony Schools Spectacular for children ranging in ages from 7-17 years. The latter programme, devised in 2002, led to the introduction of the national education scheme, Every Child A Musician, being adopted in the London borough in 2010.
Music by Shirley J. Thompson has been commissioned for several royal engagements, including Commonwealth Day performing for HM Queen Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1999, with her ensemble again for HM Queen Elizabeth’s summer party at Buckingham Palace in 2001, and opening the newly built Stratford Cultural Quarter with the London Gala Orchestra performing the Newham Symphony with Prince Edward and Countess Sophie of Wessex in attendance. In 2000 she was commissioned to compose a large-scale work to commemorate the Queen’s Golden Jubilee in 2002.
An aficionado of dance, Thompson has created music for contemporary choreographers, including commissions for the Royal Ballet School’s choreographic workshops. Her most famous dance score for solo cello and string orchestra, Shift, forms a part of the award-winning ballet, PUSH starring Sylvie Guillem and Russell Maliphant, whose international tour has led to performances at major venues in over 30 countries including: Sadler’s Wells and London Coliseum, England; Theater Heilbronn, Germany; Athens Arena, Greece; Le Metropole, Lausanne, Switzerland; Opera de Lyon, Theater Champs-Elysees, Odyssud Theatre (Toulouse) France; Teatro Comunale, (Modena); Teatro Arcimboldi (Milan); Auditorium Conciliazone di Roma (Rome); Teatro alla Fenice (Venice); San Carlo (Naples) Italy; Teatro Real (Madrid) Spain; Moscow State Opera House (Russia); St George’s Theatre, New Zealand; Sydney Opera House, Australia, City Center, New York, USA and Marinsky Theatre, St Petersburg, Russia.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Hew-Locke-Diaspora-Pavilion-768x512.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771

Tol is concerned about the wellbeing of diasporic people. Throughout her work, she wonders what has been left behind in ‘the motherland’ and what has been gained in ‘the new world’. She examines holders of knowledge (such as manuscripts & objects), community leaders of the past and present, and their abilities to transfer timeless knowledge to the ones in the future: us, and our children. She questions what it means to ‘stay ourselves’ by asking: what constitutes our origins, our losses and what have we done to reconstruct them ourselves?

Fred Tomaselli,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/fred-tomaselli/,"Drawing upon art historical sources and Eastern and Western decorative traditions, Fred Tomaselli’s works explode in mesmerizing patterns that appear to grow organically across his compositions.  In the introduction to a 2003 essay on Tomaselli’s work in Parkett magazine, curator James Rondeau writes: “Over the course of the last ten years, Fred Tomaselli has established an international reputation for his meticulously crafted, richly detailed, deliriously beautiful works of both abstract and figurative art.  His signature pieces are compelling, hybrid objects: ersatz, or maybe surrogate paintings, or tapestries, or quilts or mosaics.  Their various components—both over-the-counter and controlled pharmaceuticals, street drugs, natural psychotropic substances and other organic matter, collaged elements from printed sources, and hand-painted ornament—are all suspended in gleaming layers of clear, polished, hard resin. Forms implode, explode, oscillate, buzz, loop, swirl, and spiral.  Actual objects, photographic representations, and painted surfaces co-exist without hierarchy on and in a single picture plane.  The combined effect, neither determinably real nor fully illusionistic, is at once electrifying and destabilizing.”
Starting in 2005, Tomaselli has developed a new body of works on paper that transform the front page of The New York Times with gouache and collage. The surreal compositions are ruminations on the absurdity of news cycles and provide him a space to respond to a variety of issues – from regional anecdotes to global crises. As Tomaselli has stated, “I think that maybe the Times collages are quietly political, in that I can riff on anything I want, while the horrors of the world become the background buzz. Maybe I’m saying that the world may be going to hell, but I still keep painting.”
Fred Tomaselli (born 1956, Santa Monica, CA) has been the subject of solo exhibitions at institutions including the Joslyn Art Museum, Omaha, NE (2019); Oceanside Museum of Art, Oceanside, CA (2018); Toledo Museum of Art, Toledo, OH (2016);  Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (2014) and the University of Michigan Museum of Art (2014); a survey exhibition at Aspen Art Museum (2009) that toured to Tang Museum in Saratoga, NY and the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn NY (2010); The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh (2004) toured to four venues in Europe and the US; Albright-Knox Gallery of Art (2003); Site Santa Fe (2001); Palm Beach ICA (2001), and Whitney Museum of American Art (1999).

Nasan Tur,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/nasan-tur/,"Nasan Tur (b. 1974, Offenbach) works in an intermediate area between the public and the gallery space, drawing his material from messages and tensions he finds in the urban environment. His works comment on the conflicts and failures of ideologies either directly or indirectly. While suggesting that we must rise against repression and to struggle for fundamental democratic rights, such as freedom of the speech, he also admits the risk that resistance can turn into violence, which expands the scope of his work to cover also the ethic dimension of both individuals and community action. The overarching theme of his artistic work embraces all social struggle and the question of its justification. Nevertheless, Tur also examines the individual’s experience: personal risk taking and opening oneself to ridicule. Yet the boldness to put oneself at risk, the ability to laugh at oneself, the tenacity to try again and again, and the ability to endure failure, these are all necessary if we want to defend important values in the society.
​A key medium of Tur’s art is his own body, which he sometimes pushes to extremes, such as when he tries to break different world records or when making performative works in public spaces. In spite of their political and social tenor, his works are often humorous, astounding and sometimes shocking. Tur examines people’s activities and politics in an occasionally bemused and sometimes sorrowful way. He uses any media that suits his theme.
​Tur participated at documenta14, at the 10. Istanbul Biennale and at the 6. Taipei Biennale and exhibited in numerous institutions like Palais de Tokyo, Centre Pompidou Paris, Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, Hamburger Bahnhof Berlin, Städel Museum Frankfurt, Maxxi Museum Rome. In 2012 he was awarded the Will Grohmann Prize of the Academy of Arts, Berlin and 2014 the Villa Massimo Prize of the Deutsche Akademie Rom.

Kara Walker,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/kara-walker/,"New York-based artist Kara Walker is best known for her candid investigation of race, gender, sexuality, and violence through silhouetted figures that have appeared in numerous exhibitions worldwide.
Born in Stockton, California in 1969, Walker was raised in Atlanta, Georgia from the age of 13. She studied at the Atlanta College of Art (BFA, 1991) and the Rhode Island School of Design (MFA, 1994). She is the recipient of many awards, notably the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Achievement Award in 1997 and the United States Artists, Eileen Harris Norton Fellowship in 2008. In 2012, Walker became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2015, she was named the Tepper Chair in Visual Arts at the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University.

Guggenheim Museum, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Tate Gallery, London; the Museo Nazionale delle Arti del XXI Secolo (MAXXI), Rome; and Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt.
Walker’s major survey exhibition, Kara Walker: My Complement, My Enemy, My Oppressor, My Love, was organized by The Walker Art Center in Minneapolis where it premiered in February 2007 before traveling to ARC/ Musée d’Art moderne de la Ville de Paris; The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York; The Hammer Museum in Los Angeles; and the Museum of Modern Art in Fort Worth. Recent solo exhibitions have been presented at the Art Institute of Chicago; Camden Arts Centre in London; and Metropolitan Arts Center (MAC) in Belfast.
During the spring of 2014, Walker’s first large scale public project, a monumental installation entitled A Subtlety: Or… the Marvelous Sugar Baby an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant, was on view at the abandoned Domino Sugar refinery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Commissioned and presented by Creative Time, the project – a massive sugar covered sphinx-like sculpture – responded to and reflected on troubled history of sugar.
As a special project of the 2015 Venice Biennale, Walker was selected as director, set and costume designer for the production of Vincenzo Bellini’s Norma at Teatro La Fenice, Venice, Italy.",https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/BDVA-6-768x576.jpg,data_a478f401dc7d5fee5c6b49530448bbd6_20240926201300,2024-09-26 20:13:00.558771
Barbara Walker,https://www.internationalcuratorsforum.org/people/barbara-walker/,"Barbara Walker MBE is a British artist based in Birmingham in the UK. Her work is informed by the social, political and cultural realities that affect her life and the lives of those around her. Growing up in Birmingham, her experiences have directly shaped a practice concerned with issues of class and power, gender, race, representation and belonging. Her figurative drawings and paintings tell contemporary stories hinged on historical circumstances, making them universally understood and reflecting a human perspective on the state of affairs in her native Britain and elsewhere.
Referred to by the art historian Eddie Chambers as “one of the most talented, productive and committed artists of her generation”, Walker makes portraits in a range of media and formats, from small embossed works on paper to paintings on canvas and large-scale charcoal wall drawings. Her works depict subjects who are often cast as minorities, inviting the viewer to look beyond the anonymising act of categorising or classifying citizens. Her pictures make visible the lives of others, and address the allusions associated with the labels conferred upon people by society.
The issues of belonging, power, visibility, and representation are central to Walker’s practice. She often references public archives to create works that effectively transfer visibility back to the subject, offering an alternative and balanced interpretation of a nation’s history. The narrative of national heritage, presented through public collections, is informed by acquisitions and the collecting rationale of privileged individuals throughout history; Walker works to disrupt these limited and often skewed standpoints, and through her pictures introduces opportunities for the contemporary viewer to consider other perspectives beyond that of the powerful institution.
Walker’s recent solo exhibitions include Vanishing Point, Cristea Roberts Gallery (2022), Place, Space and who (2019) at Turner Contemporary, Vanishing Point at Jerwood Gallery (2018), Shock and Awe at Midlands Arts Centre (2016), Sub Urban at the James Hockey Gallery, part of the University for the Creative Arts in Farnham (2015) and As Seen at Tiwani Contemporary, London, (2013) Her works have been included in significant group exhibitions in the UK and internationally; exhibitions including: Life Between Islands, Caribbean – British Art, 50s to Now, Tate Britan (2021),Lahore Biennale ( 2020), Summer Show, Royal Academy of Arts (2019), Protest and Remembrance, Alan Cristea Gallery ( 2019), Zeichen, MEWO Kunsthalle, Memmingen ( 2018), Diaspora Pavilion,57th Venice Biennale (2017), A Slice Through the World: Contemporary Artists’ Drawings, Modern Art Oxford (2018) and The Gallery of Small Things, Dakar Biennale, Senegal (2018).
She has worked on a large commission for Facebook London Headquarters and other public art projects. Her work is held in private and public collections including Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, The Herbert Art Gallery, Arts Council Collection, Yale Center for British Art, Government Art Collections, The British Museum, US Embassy London and Bristol Museum and Art Gallery
