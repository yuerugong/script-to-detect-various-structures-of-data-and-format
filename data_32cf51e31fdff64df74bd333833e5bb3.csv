2024 ushers in a rich tapestry of artistic explorations across Europe, showcasing a blend of historical grandeur and contemporary innovation. In London, the Design Museum revisits the cultural impact of Barbie, while the British Museum offers a profound look at Michelangelo's later works. Paris presents compelling shows by heavyweights Mark Rothko, Mike Kelley, and Brâncuși. This year also celebrates the profound influence of Käthe Kollwitz and Caspar David Friedrich, with major retrospectives across Europe highlighting their enduring legacies. Meanwhile, the Venice Biennale promises a diverse array of international contemporary art under the intriguing theme “Stranieri Ovunque - Foreigners Everywhere”.
These highlights are just a glimpse of 2024's vibrant art calendar. Here’s our team’s roundup of the best shows this year.

Although not a new exhibition, theMark Rothkoretrospective, closing in April, is likely still unseen by many. Rothko's works, known for their moving, spiritual, and metaphysical qualities, are showcased in this exhibit featuring 115 pieces from global institutions like the National Gallery of Art, Tate London, and the Phillips Collection, as well as private collections including the artist's family. Displayed chronologically in the Fondation's Frank Gehry-designed spaces in Bois de Boulogne, this grand exhibition covers Rothko's career from early figurative to his famous abstract works. Perhaps it's the perfect palette cleanser to start the year?

Spring break doesn’t have to mean 5 litres of tequila followed by a blackout and a hangover that lasts an entire week.

CREVÉ: Jesse Darling atTriangle FranceinMarseille, France
For their first institutional solo presentation in France, Jesse Darling reflects on failing structures of power and knowledge, with works that attempt to visualise the precariousness of architectural, cultural, and corporeal bodies as a form of wounded optimism. Located in the beautifully bright space of Triangle France with large windows that give a stunning view of Marseille, Darling's work features drawings, installations and more. Included in the exhibition is a tank of fresh flowers which will remain untouched and thus wither and rot until the end of the show, speaking to the title which roughly translates to “knackered”. For a tour of the exhibition and other gems from Marseille, check out ourInstagram Story for Marseillewhich is pinned in our highlights.

The school was originally founded by Walter Gropius (whose uncle built the Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin), and throughout the years of 1919 until 1933 it created and taught the idea of the “Gesamtkunstwerk”, an idea originating from the German composer Wagner that describes a universal artwork that makes use of all art forms in its conception.

If you’re anything like us, the festive season is perfectly offset with discovering some thought-provoking contemporary art. To help you in your discovery, we’ve listed some of the best shows happening during the season in Europe. Read on to see what exhibitions you should be visiting this holiday.
The holiday season is upon us once again, and the festive light installations and window displays seen throughout the world render cities into kitschy works of art worthy of greeting cards. We’re not knocking it; we couldn’t live without our yearly dose of mulled wine and ice skating under fairy lights. But as the year winds to a close and we consume more mince pies and cider than our bellies can take, we’re left wondering if we’ve consumed enough art and culture.
Read on to see what exhibitions you should be visiting. May your holidays be the perfect mix of cosy and stimulating.

Moscow:The Fabric of Felicity atThe Museum of Contemporary Art ""Garage""
The large group show at The Garage oscillates around the subject of clothing in art considered outside the context of the fashion industry. The geography of the exhibition is based on the “silk routes” of the 21st century - global routes and production cycles of raw materials, fabrics and ready-made clothes. Including works of Russian as well as international artists, the exhibition attempts to strip the concept of clothing from its association with fashion and style.

We’ve compiled some of the most instagrammable exhibitions from London and beyond so that your perfect Fashion Week finds will be set against the most perfect backdrops.
The cooler season sees cosmopolitan cities all over the world racking up their stylish best for their respective fashion weeks. Because London is home to one of the biggest Fashion Weeks in the world, and because it's also home to ArtRabbit, it's times like these that we reflect on the natural friendship (and sometimes grating opposition) between art and design. While design has the stigma of commercialisation and caters to functionality, and while a single glance at artist-made exhibition posters is enough to convince anyone that artists are not inherently designers, there is undeniably some crossover between the two.
As icons and influencers flock to various fashion capitals, we’re spoiled with endless interesting outfits to look at. Designers unleash their own takes on wearable art, and walking down particular streets in central London is almost like gallery hopping without the walls. And maybe fashion, to some extent, belongs on the streets. But in making aesthetic connections between current trends in fashion and current trends in art, we think that a lot of these outfits can be augmented with a backdrop of art.
If your entire social feed is already flooded with selfies of new fashion finds taken at Sketch and the Bussey Building, you’ll be happy to know that we’ve got you covered for new places to show off your style. We’ve compiled some of the most instagrammable exhibitions from London and beyond so that your Fashion Week finds will be the most aesthetic of them all.

What better way to balance out the material aspects of your wardrobe than with some highly informed metaphysics?

Interesting designs are often inspired by a base of interesting textiles and other materials, and few get our inspiration juices flowing like the raw material-versus-colour tensions of this collaboration betweenAiko HachisukaandJohn Williams. Hachisuka’s silkscreened cloth form sculptural mounds while William’s paintings play with depths of colour. Movement and abstraction become perfectly bold patterns to augment the textiles you’re showcasing.

Tanya Aguiñiga: Craft & Care atMAD - Museum of Arts and Design
If you haven’t already, this is your last chance to see (and pose in front of) Tanya Aguiñiga’s Craft & Care at MAD-Museum of Arts and Design. Her work is a spectacular exploration of design as politics, and the connection between design-thinking and community-making. Visually arresting as it is politically significant, the exhibition features photographic documentation, radio broadcasts, ephemera, data, and several other works from her ongoing design practice. Included in this is an installation generated by AMBOS (Art Made Between Opposite Sides), a long-term initiative that activates sites along the US–Mexico border through collaborative art-making and storytelling projects.

Blood in My Milk byMarianna Simnettbrings together new multi-screen edits of four of the artist's most important work to date, chronicling her close look at female organs, body parts, and infection through the lens of medical treatment and procedures. Narratives bleed together to reveal the discomfort hidden by medical and industrial procedures, an environment to offset our fashionable outer layer with the awkward substantiation of our fleshy, organic existence.

Videogrames: Design/Play/Disrupt atVictoria & Albert Museum
Anyone who’s ever played video games will appreciate the fantastical landscapes that a manufactured world can feature. As the name suggests, this exhibition explores video games as a medium under constant evolution since the mid-2000s. Boundary-breaking by taking new technologies and running with it, the show delves into every aspect from the initial designs of each individual character to critical discussions on the wider sociopolitical scope that game design exists within. Even if you don’t need the sure to be interesting works to offset your designer wares, you’ll gain some insight into the multilayered world of gaming.

While nature indisputably has been a source of inspiration for art throughout the centuries, the current show at the V&A brings attention to a less obvious relationship: the relation between nature and fashion design. The exhibits range from historical dresses from the 1600s to innovative fabrics and dyeing processes that are yet to conquer the fashion industry. Expect works from top fashion designers such as Stella McCartney but also Victorian dresses decorated with beetle wing cases.

Against the backdrop of a white-tiled hall filled with bronze sculptures and the makings of an acid-induced reverie, have a fashion-off with a performer donned in Shakespearean frills and a squash head. That sentence might sound like it’s being metaphorical, but we mean it as we say it.Anthea Hamilton’s Tate Britain Commission consists in the entirety of the Duveen Galleries transformed into a dreamscape with a minimal gridlike makeover and a performer who wears a squash costume based on a photograph she saw several years ago of a scene from a dance by American choreographer Erick Hawkins. The work is about memory and humour, and the reimagining of existence as something completely other.

Christian Marclay. The Clock atTate Modern
As if you haven’t been constantly checking your watch worried that you’ll be late to all the glamorous events, Marclay’s iconic piece made its way to London from Tel Aviv just in time for the Fashion Week. Unlike most of the video art, you don’t need to worry about making it on time for the screening hours. The Clock is a lapsed 24h long installation that consists of thousands of shots of clocks sourced out from various films. Assembled together by the artist using his championed fragment technique, the artwork becomes a documentation of the history of fashion as seen on film throughout the past 70 years of cinematography. What’s more is that it’s actually synced with the real time of the day. Don’t know what hour it is? Well, Big Ben is still under construction so just pop into Tate Modern and let Marclay tell you the time.
Open Sunday-Thursday 10AM-6PM, Friday-Saturday 10AM-10PM. Free Admission.

Slight Agitation 4/4: Laura Lima atPrada Foundation
Since 1995, The Prada Foundation has been co-chaired by Miuccia Prada and for over 20 years has brought world-class artists into Milan’s art scene. ‘Slight Agitation 4/4’ is the last instalment of the project constituted of site-specific works located in the Foundation’s Cisterna spaces.Laura Lima’s installations transform the venue into a social experiment where the viewers are invited to explore concepts of the imaginary and the real. The works stimulate human perception and confuse in the most aesthetically pleasing way (just as you’d expect from an art institution supervised by Prada.)

Leonor Antunes. the last days in Galliate atPirelli Hangar Bicocca
Taking her inspiration from art history, design, and architecture,Leonor Antunestransforms meticulously researched details into large sculptures designed specifically for the 1,400 square meter space of Pirelli Hangar Bicocca. The experience of looking at Antunes’ works resembles walking around a magical haberdashery or jewellery store with every artisanal work being handcrafted to perfection. For her sculptures, the artist uses natural organic materials such as rope, wood, leather, brass, rubber, and cork, among others that reflect the imprint of time. If we could file requests for the designs we’d like to see at the Met Gala, we’d be voting for Antunes.

Simone Forti. On an iron post atGalleria Raffaella Cortese
Simone Fortihas been the leading contributor to the emergence of performance art since the 1960s. The retrospective show at Galleria Raffaella Cortese juxtaposes the artist’s newest works with some of her iconic historical pieces. A turning point in Forti’s career is visible through her works from the Roman period when the artist lived by the local zoo. She became fascinated by the animals and began to incorporate their behaviours into her performances. With a strong focus on the beauty of the human body and movement, Forti summarises the show as “an invitation to let your body have its own ideas and thoughts.”

A truly last chance to get lost in the mazy galleries of La Maison Rouge, ‘L’envol’ marks the last exhibition at the gallery before their closing down after fourteen years. Containing works of over 50 artists, the show responds to various interpretations of the concept of flying. The artworks shown exhaust every possible artistic medium and constitute a complete archive of the history of flight in the artistic practice. These include Rebecca Horn’s feather prosthetics (aka the grandmothers of Victoria’s Secret’s Angel’s wings) and Fabio Mauri’s interactive styrofoam installation which attempts to recreate the impression of walking on the moon’s surface.

When you’re running between the independent designer boutiques in Le Marais, pop in Centre Pompidou to see a large retrospective of works by this unique Austrian artist.Franz West’s sculptures redefine the medium’s relation to the human body and often invite the viewers to engage with their structure. To complement the show, some of West’s outdoor designs and furniture pieces will be scattered around the streets and venues of Le Marais, playing with the public’s perception of the beautiful and the ugly, the repulsive and the seductive. A friendly note: while in Paris, pay close attention before you sit down to rest your tortured feet donned in designer heels because you might be accidentally sitting on the most Instagrammable piece of art in town.

If you’re lucky enough to be doing a bit of vacationing in Europe this summer, or even if you’re just in town for work and have some time in between meetings, we wanted to share with you our favourites from across the continent.
It’s hard to believe the past few months have gone by so quickly, and that only last week we were complaining about the weather. Well actually, being based in London, bemoaning the weather happens all year round. In between those spots of grey, we get our fair share of sunshine that inspires us to leave the safety of our bedrooms and soak in as much art as we possibly can. But when that inevitable lukewarm dreariness of bad weather hits, we take it as a sign to skip town and find amazing art elsewhere. In doing so, our list of exhibitions to see continues to grow.
If you’re lucky enough to be doing a bit of vacationing in Europe this summer, or even if you’re just in town for work and have some time in between meetings, we wanted to share with you our favourites from across the continent. Here are some of our top picks for European Art Cities that will help balance your well-deserved rest (or chaotic schedule) with some outstanding contemporary culture.

A Beautiful Moment at Huis Marseille Museum for Photography
The photographic exhibition atHuis Marseillesearches for traces of similarity in works by a group of photographers all originating from Japan. It oscillates around the idea of wabi-sabi: two key concepts from classic Japanese aesthetics. Wabi has been described as ‘serene attention to simple things’ and sabi as ‘beauty acquired through the patina of time’ which manifest themselves through the profound sensitivity to the various manifestations of nature, and in an acute attentiveness to the beauty of superficially unremarkable details of the photographs.

George Drivas: Laboratory of Dilemmas at National Museum of Contemporary Art, Athens (EMST)
George Drivas' imposing video installation Laboratory of Dilemmas represented Greece at the 57th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia. If you missed it in 2017, enjoy it now atEMST. The material is very contemporary, addressing current global sociopolitical issues, and dealing with the anguish, puzzlement, and confusion of individuals and social groups when called upon to address moral dilemmas. Loosely based on Aeschylus' playIketides (Suppliant Women), the peripatetic audiovisual experience poses a dilemma between saving the Foreigner and maintaining the safety of the Native. The story is presented piecemeal through multiple video and sound sources inside a labyrinth. While walking through the labyrinth the play’s dilemma unfolds through the excerpts of an unfinished documentary about a scientific experiment.

Hieroglyphs – Symbolist Drawings 1890-1910 at National Gallery of Denmark | SMK - Statens Museum for Kunst
The Danes know all about introspection if esteemed Danish philosopher Kierkegaard is of any indication. This exhibition shows drawings from the late nineteenth century when a group of Danish artists became fed up with naturalism and its ideals of depicting reality in an objective, neutral manner. Their response was to turn to humanity’s inner life instead, to emotions and thoughts. Known as Symbolism, this mode of expression gives rise to pictures that are both decorative, mystical and enigmatic – often described as ‘soul pictures’ in Danish art.

Hannah Fitz: Knock Knock at Temple Bar Gallery + Studios
Always an oasis of culture in chaotic touristy downtown,Temple Bar Gallery + Studiosin Dublin features a consistent itinerary of both internationally renowned and locally sourced artists. This season sees the first solo show by Irish artist Hannah Fitz, whose sculptures are reductive illustrations of everyday objects, stilled and deadened with a self-conscious agency. Their limited material qualities cause them to fall back in on themselves like a stumbled punchline, “knock-knock” followed by an accidental awkwardness.
